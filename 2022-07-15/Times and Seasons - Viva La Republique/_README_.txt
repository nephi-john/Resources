12 "months" each have 30 days.  A "week" is a decan with two pentads (M-F) for the two genders (M/F). [Non-binaries at any point in time can choose to be assigned either M or F.]  The first "week" is the mother/father, the second "week" is the daughter/son, the third "week" is the al-mother/al-father (grandparents*).

Days are:  left-side: thumb, index, middle, ring, pinkie; right-side: thumb, index, middle, ring, pinkie (how you would contiguously count to 5 of each hand).

First day of "pentad" is thumb.  Up/heaven or down/earth (maybe cycle between spiritual rest with heaven and spiritual rest with earth)...

There are four epochs of time in a year (solstice/equinox).  They are NOT seasons.  There are 3 seasons in the year (growing, harvesting, waiting).  Businesses should consider moving from Q to T.

== no dealings with LUNATIONS (moon) ... 
== no dealings with aligning epochs with calendar

Every year there are "out-of-time" extra-calendar days ... They occur at the END of the year before the first day of year (March 21 equinox).  

** TIME will be computed based on LEAP YEARS rather than annually determining the TRUE EQUINOX.
** TIME will be anchored to a fixed point (either the center of Khufer/Giza pyramid or the center of the oval at Serpent Mound, Ohio).  All timezones will anchor to this fixed point and will be based on LONGITUDE w/o any weird exceptions.  Each timezone will be a function of "10 degrees" ... 36 divisions of time to equate to the 36 hours in the day ... Hours will be based on the notion that they are equal at the EQUINOX (12/12 becomes 18/18).  Latitude, Longitude should be able to ascertain the time at any point on earth using the 36-hour model.  As epoch's hours can be halfed (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, ...) ... This time measure is about day-time not fixed seconds.  That is, in winter in Alaska there may be 18 day hours each with 0 fixed seconds.  What time is it BECOMES a function of SOLAR NOON where you live (half of sunrise/sunset where these times account for refraction and obstructions like mountains) ... that is, VISIBLE LIGHT ... sunrise (first light) to sunset (last light, even though sun has already set, refraction).  WINTER months have shorter hours, SUMMER months have longer hours... This time can be measured on a SUNDIAL (Asherah May Pole) and can be linked to modern "water clocks" such as crystals and atomic clocks. [A day schedule becomes a problem, maybe we should keep things that generic:  I will get to work "one hour" after sunrise {which changes every day} ... I will be there "half past noon" {half hour past solar noon}] ... Time is a function of Latitude and Longitude and Solar Date ... 



By default, there are 5 extra days (XELA days) celebrated outside of months... XELA-1,...,XELA-5.  This is not a month, as a month has 30 days.  There are no associated days of the week associated with these days as they are not part of a week.  They are outside of time.

If the YEAR is divisible by 5 (YEAR MOD 5 == 0), there is an additional XELA day.  (e.g., XELA-6)
If the YEAR is divisible by 25 (YEAR MOD 25 == 0), there is an additional XELA day.  (e.g., XELA-7)
If the YEAR is divisible by 500 (YEAR MOD 500 == 0), there is an additional XELA day.  (e.g., XELA-8)
If the YEAR is divisible by 5000 (YEAR MOD 5000 == 0), there is an additional XELA day.  (e.g., XELA-9)

Obviously, XELA-9 (5000) implies XELA-8 (500) which implies XELA-7 (25) and XELA-6 (5)

Names of Months, Weeks (Decans), Pentads, Days of Week all TBD ... but universally they can be calculated ...

Every month has 6 pentads and 3 decans.

You could have local decans/pentads and/or global ones.

Pentad(1) is first 1/2 Decan(1) ... Pentad 2 is second 1/2 Decan(1)

MONTH1-1, ... MONTH1-30, MONTH2-1, ... MONTH2-30,

XELA-1...XELA-9 ... XELA is not a month ... they are epagomenal days ... days of celebration (our days were lengthened) ... XELA name TBD.  

MONTH1-1, ... MONTH1-30, MONTH2-1, ... MONTH2-30, ... MONTH12-1, ... MONTH12-30, ---> XELA-1, XELA-2, XELA-n, --->  MONTH1-1
