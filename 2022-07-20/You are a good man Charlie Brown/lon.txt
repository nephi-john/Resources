* NEPHI JOHN DECEMBER 13, 2020
1Ne 1:1	My name is Nephi. I had good parents^.  They taught me many things about the culture of my father (Lehi).  My life was full of challenges.  Even so, God blessed me.  God gave me great knowledge of His goodness and His empheries.  He told me to write down my story.
1Ne 1:2	I record this story in my father's language: a blend of the Egyptian language and the Jewish culture.
1Ne 1:3	I write this story with my own hand.  I acknowledge that it is true as best^ as I can  recall.  
1Ne 1:4	I start^ this story in the land^ of Jerusalem.  My father, Lehi, had lived there all of his life.  The story begins in the year Zedekiah^   became the king of Judah.  That year, many prophets came.  These prophets foretold that the great city of Jerusalem would be destroyed unless the people change their ways. 
1Ne 1:5	One day, Lehi was out and about^.  He was praying to God with all of his heart for his people. 
1Ne 1:6	As he prayed to God, a pillar of fire^ appeared on a rock in front of him.  He saw and heard many things.  This experience greatly affected him. He trembled involuntarily. 
1Ne 1:7	Overwhelmed by what he saw, Lehi returned to his house^ in the land of Jerusalem and went to bed.
1Ne 1:8	In his bed, Lehi was overcome with the Spirit and had a vision.  He saw the heavens open.  He thought^ he saw God sitting on His throne.  God was surrounded by an assembly of more angels than Lehi could count.  These angels were singing and praising God.
1Ne 1:9	Next, Lehi saw One Angel descend from heaven.  This angel was full of light, resplendent like the sun at midday.
1Ne 1:10	Lehi also saw twelve other angels follow the First Angel.  These angels were also full of light They were more resplendent than the stars in the firmament.
1Ne 1:11	These angels (the First and the twelve) descended^ from heaven and went forth on the earth. The First Angel approached Lehi.  Standing next to my father, The First Angel gave him a book and asked him to read it.
1Ne 1:12	My father began to read from this book.  He felt God's Spirit.
1Ne 1:13	Lehi read:  \Lehi{``Wo unto Jerusalem,  I have seen your evil practices!''}  My father read many things about Jerusalem.  He learned that because of wickedness the city would be destroyed.  Many of the people would die by the sword.  The survivors would be forced to leave Jerusalem.  They would go to Babylon as captives.  
1Ne 1:14	Lehi saw and heard many important things in his vision.  After, Lehi praised God.  \Lehi{``Great and marvelous are Your works, O God Almighty!  Your throne is high in the heavens yet Your power and goodness and mercy encompass all the inhabitants of the earth!  Because You are merciful, You will not allow those who embrace Your teachings to perish!''}  
1Ne 1:15	After receiving this revelation from God, my father was happy.  He continued to praise God.  His soul rejoiced and his heart was full of joy. 
1Ne 1:16	I (Nephi) do not write everything my father Lehi shared^ with our family.  Lehi wrote many things he saw in visions and in dreams [in his own book].  He also wrote down many things he prophesied to his children.  I will not write everything my father has already written.
1Ne 1:17	I want to tell my story.  However, before I do, I will continue to summarize^ my father's story.  Then I will return to my story.
1Ne 1:18	After receiving these revelations, my father Lehi began to preach to the people.  He declared what God showed him concerning the destruction of Jerusalem.  
1Ne 1:19	The Jewish people ridiculed Lehi as he prophesied to them.  Lehi told the Jews^ they were wicked. Lehi also shared many of the things he saw and heard in his visions.  He taught them things he read in the book.  He taught them about the coming of the Messiah (Yeshua).  He taught them that Yeshua would redeem the world.
1Ne 1:20	When the Jews heard^ Lehi prophesying, they became very angry with Lehi. (Jews have a history of casting out, stoning, or killing the prophets of old.) They wanted to kill my father.  But God protects those He has chosen with kind benevolence.  God makes His chosen mighty.  God gives them power to be rescued from danger and evil.  All because of their faith.
1Ne 2:1	Thereafter, God spoke to my father Lehi in a dream and said:  \God{``You are blessed Lehi because you prophesied to the Jewish people as I asked.  Because you have been faithful in preaching repentance to them, they want to kill you.''}
1Ne 2:2	In this dream, God commanded Lehi to take his family and leave^ the land of Jerusalem and go into the wilderness. 
1Ne 2:3	Lehi obeyed God and departed into the wilderness with his^ family.
1Ne 2:4	Lehi left^ behind his house. He left behind the land of his inheritance.  He left behind his gold, silver, and precious^ things.  He took nothing with him but his family, provisions, and tents^.  He departed^ into the wilderness. 
1Ne 2:5	Lehi and his family traveled^ in the wilderness near the shore of the Red Sea.  Then, they traveled nearer^ the shore of the Red Sea. Lehi traveled with his family:  my mother Sariah and my elder brothers Laman, Lemuel, and Sam [and me Nephi^ of course].
1Ne 2:6	After traveling for [an additional] three days^ in the wilderness, Lehi pitched his tent in a valley along the shore of a river^.
1Ne 2:7	Lehi built an altar of stones and made an offering^ to God.  Lehi praised and thanked God. 
1Ne 2:8	Lehi named the river Laman.  This river emptied into the Red Sea.  The valley was near the mouth of the Red Sea.
1Ne 2:9	Lehi saw the waters of the river.  He spoke to Laman saying:  \Lehi{``O that you might be like this river, continually^ springing forth righteousness!''} 
1Ne 2:10	Next, Lehi spoke to Lemuel: \Lehi{``O that you might be like this valley, firm^ and steadfast, immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord!''} 
1Ne 2:11	Lehi spoke these words because Laman and Lemuel were stubborn^, haughty, and proud.  They did murmur against their father.  They complained often.  They criticized him as a visionary man.  They protested that he led them out of Jerusalem.  That he made them leave the land of their^ inheritance.  That he made them leave behind the gold, silver, and precious things.  They accused him of leading them into the wilderness to perish.  And they complained that Lehi did all this because of his foolish imaginations of the heart.
1Ne 2:12	In this manner did my oldest brothers (Laman and Lemuel) murmur against our father.  They murmured because they did not understand God's plan.  The God who had created them.
1Ne 2:13	Laman and Lemuel did not believe that the great and mighty city of Jerusalem could be destroyed.  They did not believe the prophets.  They did not believe their father.  They were like many of those in Jerusalem.  Those in Jerusalem that wanted to kill Lehi.
1Ne 2:14	Lehi spoke firmly to Laman and Lemuel in the valley of Lemuel.  He spoke with the power of God, being filled with the Spirit.  He confounded their murmuring.  He put the fear of God into them.  Their frames did shake before him.  They began to listen to his orders. 
1Ne 2:15	Lehi dwelt in a tent.
1Ne 2:16	I (Nephi) although large for my age, was very young.  I did not rebel against my father like my brothers did.  Nevertheless, I very much desired to know the empheries of God.  I secluded^ myself and earnestly prayed to God.  God visited me.  God softened my heart and I did believe all the words of my father. 
1Ne 2:17	I told Sam what I had experienced.  I shared that the God made clear His will by the Holy Spirit.  Sam believed me.
1Ne 2:18	Laman and Lemuel would not listen to me.  I was grieved because they hardened their hearts and refused to believe me.  I prayed earnestly for them.
1Ne 2:19	God spoke to me saying: \God{``You are blessed, Nephi, because of your faith.  You have humbled yourself before Me.  You have diligently sought to follow Me.''}
1Ne 2:20	\God{``If you keep my commandments, you will be led to a promised land.  Yes, a select land that I have prepared for you.  A land which is preferred above all other lands!''}
1Ne 2:21	\God{``If your brothers rebel against you, they will be cut off from My presence.''}
1Ne 2:22	\God{``If you keep My commandments, you will become a teacher and ruler over your brothers.''}
1Ne 2:23	\God{``When your brothers rebel against Me, I will curse^ them severely.  I will curse them and their^ seed.  They will not have power over you or your seed.''} 
1Ne 2:24	\God{``If your seed also rebels against Me, your brothers' seed will afflict yours to stir them up in the ways of remembrance.''}
1Ne 3:1	I (Nephi) returned from speaking to God.  I entered the tent of my father.
1Ne 3:2	Lehi spoke to me, saying:  \Lehi{``I have had a dream.  God has told me that you^ and your brothers need to return to Jerusalem.''}
1Ne 3:3	\Lehi{``Laban^  has the record of the Jews and also our family genealogy.  These things are engraven upon pages made of a brass alloy (brass plates).''}
1Ne 3:4	\Lehi{``God told me that you and your brothers need to go to Laban's house.  Get the family history.  Bring it back to me here in the wilderness.''}
1Ne 3:5	\Lehi{``Your brothers are complaining saying this is too difficult^ a task that I require.  But I don't require it.  God requires it.''}
1Ne 3:6	\Lehi{``Nephi, go my son.  Because you don't complain, God will give you success!''}
1Ne 3:7	I (Nephi) replied to my father:  \Nephi{``I will go and do^ the things God commands.  I know that God doesn't give a task to His children unless He has prepared a way for them to fulfill the task.''}
1Ne 3:8	When Lehi heard my response, he was very happy.  He knew that God had touched my heart.
1Ne 3:9	So I (Nephi) and my brothers began our journey in the wilderness, with our tents^, to return to the land of Jerusalem.
1Ne 3:10	When we returned to Jerusalem, we consulted with each other to determine how we should accomplish this task.
1Ne 3:11	We cast lots^ to determine who should go to Laban's house.  The lot fell upon Laman, so Laman went to Laban's house.  Laman sat with Laban in his house.
1Ne 3:12	Laman shared^ his desire to get the family history from Laban. 
1Ne 3:13	Laban became angry. Laban told Laman he could not have the family history.   Laban told Laman to get out of his house.    Laban accused^  Laman of being a robber and threatened to kill Laman.
1Ne 3:14	Laman ran away from Laban and returned to us (brothers).  Upon hearing this story, we were all dejected.  My brothers wanted to return to my father in the wilderness.
1Ne 3:15	I said to them:  \Nephi{``As God lives, and as we live, we will not return to our father in the wilderness until we complete this task.''}
1Ne 3:16	\Nephi{``Let us be faithful^ to God. [I have an idea.] Let's go to the land of our father's inheritance.  Remember, God told him to leave behind the gold, silver and other precious things.''}
1Ne 3:17	\Nephi{``Remember, father knew that Jerusalem is going to be destroyed because of the wickedness of the people.''}
1Ne 3:18	\Nephi{``Remember, the Jewish people have rejected the words of the prophets.  Remember, if my father were to have stayed, they would have killed him.  That is why he left.  God told him to leave before he would be killed.''}
1Ne 3:19	\Nephi{``Remember, we need this family history.  It is God's wisdom.  With the written record of the Jews, we can teach our children the language (and culture) of our fathers.''}
1Ne 3:20	\Nephi{``And we can also preserve for our children the words which have been spoken by the holy prophets.  The words delivered to these prophets by the Spirit and power of God.  The words delivered since the world began down to the present time.''}
1Ne 3:21	In this way, I persuaded my brothers.  We needed to complete this task.
1Ne 3:22	So we went to the land of our inheritance.  We gathered together our gold, silver, and precious things.
1Ne 3:23	After we collected these things, we all went together to Laban's house.
1Ne 3:24	We went into Laban's house and again requested that he give us the family history engraven on the brass plates.  In exchange^, we would give him all of this gold, silver, and precious things.
1Ne 3:25	When Laban saw^ our substantial riches, he wanted them.  He took them by force.  He told us to get out and commanded his servants to kill us.  He did this so he could take our property.
1Ne 3:26	We did run away from Laban's servants.  As a result, we left behind our property.  Laban seized it for his own.
1Ne 3:27	We ran into the wilderness.  We hid in the hollow of a rock.  Laban's servants did not find us.
1Ne 3:28	Laman was angry with me.  Laman was also angry with my father.  Lemuel agreed with Laman, and was also very angry^.  Together they spoke harshly to Sam and I.  They were so angry that they began to strike us with a stick.
1Ne 3:29	God sent an angel to stop this physical assault: \Angel{``Why do you strike your younger brother with this stick?  Don't you know that he will rule over you because of your improper behavior?  Go back to Jerusalem, and God will deliver Laban into your hands.''} 
1Ne 3:30	After the angel said these things, he departed.
1Ne 3:31	After the angel departed, Laman and Lemuel again murmured saying: \Brothers{``How will God deliver Laban into our hands?  Laban is a mighty man.  He can command fifty.  He can even slay fifty.  Why won't he slay the four of us!''}
1Ne 4:1	I (Nephi) again responded to my brothers and their murmuring:  \Nephi{``Let's go back to Jerusalem again.  Let's be true and faithful to God in completing this task.  God is mightier than Laban's fifty.  God is mightier than tens of thousands.  God is mightier than all the earth.''}
1Ne 4:2	\Nephi{``Let's go.  Let's be strong like Moses.  Moses had faith and truly spoke to the waters of the Red Sea.  And the waters parted so our fathers could cross on dry ground. When the armies of Pharaoh followed [on chariots] , the waters crashed down upon them.  They drowned.''}
1Ne 4:3	\Nephi{``Brothers, you know^ this story is true.  Why then do you doubt now?  An angel just told you God will help us.  Let's go and get this done.  God will deliver us to destroy^ Laban as God delivered our fathers to destroy the Egyptians.''} 
1Ne 4:4	After saying these things, my brothers calmed a bit.  But they were still angry.  And they continued murmuring.  However, they did follow me back to Jerusalem.  We stopped just outside the walls of the city.
1Ne 4:5	It was night.  I told my brothers to hide outside the city walls.  After they hid, I snuck^ into the city.  I headed towards the house of Laban.
1Ne 4:6	I was led by the Spirit.  I did not know beforehand what I was about to do.
1Ne 4:7	I approached the house of Laban.  As I got near, I saw a drunk^ man slumbering on the ground.
1Ne 4:8	I recognized the man. It was Laban! 
1Ne 4:9	Laban was carrying a sword.  I drew the sword from its sheath.  The sword was splendid. The hilt was pure gold with exquisite^ workmanship.  The blade was made from the most precious steel^.
1Ne 4:10	I felt compelled by the Spirit that I should kill Laban.  I felt this powerful prompting, yet hesitated.  Never had I killed^ a man.  I hesitated because I did not want to kill him.
1Ne 4:11	The Spirit reminded me that God has delivered Laban into my hands.  I also reviewed what had recently transpired.  Laban tried to kill me.  Laban would not give us the family history.  Laban stole our gold, silver, and precious things. 
1Ne 4:12	Again, the Spirit told me:  \Spirit{``Kill him.  God has delivered Laban into your hands.''} 
1Ne 4:13	\Spirit{``God destroys the wicked to realize His righteous purposes.  It is better than one man dies than a nation should fall away in unbelief.''} 
1Ne 4:14	After hearing these words, I also remembered what God had taught^ me when I prayed in the wilderness: \God{``If your seed keeps My commandments, they will prosper in the promised land.''}
1Ne 4:15	I reasoned that my posterity could not keep God's commandments (according to the law of Moses) if they did not have a written record of the law.
1Ne 4:16	I knew the law was engraven on the brass plates.
1Ne 4:17	I also knew that God had delivered Laban into my hands.  God wanted me to complete this task and get the family genealogy and the written record of the prophets. 
1Ne 4:18	Finally, I obeyed the voice of the Spirit.  I took Laban by the hair of his head.  I cut off his head with his own sword.
1Ne 4:19	After killing Laban with his own sword, I put on Laban's clothing.  I even put on his armor^.
1Ne 4:20	Dressed like Laban, I walked towards the treasury in Laban's house.  I recognized Laban's servant that had the keys to the treasury.  I called to the servant using the voice of Laban.  I commanded him to bring the keys and follow me to the treasury.  Together, the servant and I went into the treasury.  
1Ne 4:21	The servant thought I was Laban.  I was wearing his garments, his armor, and had his sword.
1Ne 4:22	The servant asked me how my night out had been with the elders of the Jews.
1Ne 4:23	I answered him as if^ I was Laban. 
1Ne 4:24	I told him that I wanted to carry^ the brass plates to my brothers who were outside the city walls.  
1Ne 4:25	I told him to follow me. 
1Ne 4:26	The servant thought I was refering to elders of the Jews when I said brothers.  He thought I was Laban, so he obeyed and followed me.
1Ne 4:27	While we walked to the city walls, the servant talked quite a lot about the elders of the Jews.
1Ne 4:28	When Laman saw me, he thought I was Laban.  He was very^ afraid.  Lemuel and Sam were also very afraid.  My brothers began to run away.  They thought I was Laban.  They thought Laban had killed me and now were coming to kill them.
1Ne 4:29	I called to my brothers.  They understood it was me.  They stopped running away.
1Ne 4:30	The servant then recognized my brothers.  He realized they were not the elders of the Jews.  He began to quiver with fear.  He was about to run away and return to the city of Jerusalem.
1Ne 4:31	(I am a large^  man in stature.  God has given me natural strength.)  I grabbed the servant of Laban and held him, preventing him from running away.
1Ne 4:32	I talked to the servant.  I told him that if he would listen to me and listen to God I would not kill him.
1Ne 4:33	I swore an oath: \Nephi{``As I live and as God lives, I promised you will be a free^ man if you come with us into the wilderness.''} 
1Ne 4:34	I assured him by saying:  \Nephi{``Truly God commanded us to do this thing.  Are we not supposed to do what God commands?  If you go into the wilderness with us to my father, you will have a place with us.''}
1Ne 4:35	The name of the servant was Zoram.  Zoram did take courage as I made these promises to him.  Zoram promised me that he would go with us into the wilderness to our father.  He also made an oath to us that he would remain with us from now on.
1Ne 4:36	We wanted Zoram to come with us so the Jews would not know what we have done.  We did not want them to know where we had gone.  We did not want them to pursue us.  We did not want them to destroy us. 
1Ne 4:37	Zoram made an oath to us.  This alleviated our fears.
1Ne 4:38	We took the brass plates and Zoram (the servant of Laban) and departed into the wilderness.  We journeyed to the tent of our father.  
1Ne 5:1	My father was filled with joy to see us when we arrived.  My mother, Sariah, was also very pleased.  She had, in fact, mourned because of us.
1Ne 5:2	She had supposed that we had died in the wilderness.  She had murmured^ against my father.  She told Lehi that he was a visionary man. She said^: \Sariah{``Lehi, you have led us away from the land of our inheritance.  My sons are dead.  And now, we are dying^ in the wilderness.''}
1Ne 5:3	This is how my mother complained against my father.
1Ne 5:4	My father responder to her: \Lehi{``Yes, I am a visionary man.  If I had not seen the things of God in a vision, I would not have known of the goodness of God. I would have stayed in Jerusalem.  I would have died.''} 
1Ne 5:5	\Lehi{``God has granted us a better land of inheritance, a land of promise.  I am happy for this.  I am certain that God will deliver our sons out of the hands of Laban.  I know God will bring them back to us in the wilderness.''}
1Ne 5:6	In this manner, my father, Lehi, tried to comfort my mother Sariah while we were gone.
1Ne 5:7	When we arrived, my father was filled with joy.  My mother was comforted.
1Ne 5:8	My mother said: \Sariah{``Now^ I know for sure that God commanded my husband to flee Jerusalem and come into the wilderness.  I also know for certain that God protected my sons.  God delivered them out of the hands of Laban.  God gave them power to accomplish the task God had given them.''} 
1Ne 5:9	My parents rejoiced exceedingly when we returned. They offered a sacrifice^ and burnt offerings to God.  They gave thanks to the God of Israel.
1Ne 5:10	After giving thanks to the God of Israel, my father, Lehi, turned his attention to the history engraven on the brass plates.  He began to carefully study the contents, starting from the beginning.  
1Ne 5:11	Lehi learned that the record contained the five books of Moses.  This includes an account of the creation of the world and the story of our first parents, Adam and Eve.
1Ne 5:12	The record also contained the written history of the Jews.  The history from the beginning to now.  (At present, the current king of Judah is Zedekiah^.)
1Ne 5:13	The plates also contained the prophecies^ of the holy prophets.  This includes prophets from the beginning to now.  Many (not all) of Jeremiah's prophecies are also written on the plates.
1Ne 5:14	My father, Lehi, also found on the brass plates a genealogy of his fathers.  Lehi learned how he was a descendant^ of Joseph.  Even the Joseph who was the son of Jacob.  The same Joseph who was sold into Egypt by his brothers.  The same Joseph preserved by God so that he would preserve his father Jacob.  Because of these events, Jacob's family [the nation of Israel] did not die of hunger.
1Ne 5:15	The Israel nation was also led out of captivity from Egypt by the same God that preserved them from famine.  
1Ne 5:16	Indeed, Lehi examined the genealogy of his fathers. And he discovered that Laban was also a descendant of Joseph.  This is why Laban and his fathers^  had kept the records. 
1Ne 5:17	After reviewing the plates, Lehi was filled with the Spirit.  He began to prophesy concerning his seed.
1Ne 5:18	Lehi prophesized that the contents of these brass plates should go forth^ to all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.  
1Ne 5:19	Lehi declared that these brass plates should never perish.  Neither should they be dimmed^ by time. Lehi also prophesied many things concerning his seed.
1Ne 5:20	So far, my father and I had performed the tasks God had commanded.
1Ne 5:21	We had obtained the records just as God had required.  We studied them and discovered they were fascinating.  We began to realize how valuable the records were.  The records would enable us and our children to remember God and His commandments.
1Ne 5:22	God is wise!  He knew we should take these brass plates with us.  With us on this journey into the wilderness en route to the land of promise.
1Ne 6:1	I am not going to write down the genealogy of my fathers in this book.  Lehi already wrote it down in his book.   
1Ne 6:2	It is sufficient to say that we are descendants of Joseph.
1Ne 6:3	 My intent is not to give a full account of my father's story.  I don't have enough space on these small plates. I will prioritize and write the things of God, as they pertain to my story.
1Ne 6:4	My intent is to persuade men to come to the true God.  Only the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob can save men.
1Ne 6:5	I do not write things that are pleasing to the world.  I write things that are pleasing to God. I write things that are pleasing to those who are not of the world.
1Ne 6:6	I will tell my seed to write down only important things on these small plates.  By important things, I mean things that have worth for the children of men.
1Ne 7:1	After my father, Lehi, finished prophesying concerning his seed, God again spoke to Lehi.  God said it was not proper for Lehi to take his family into the wilderness alone.  Lehi's sons would need wives^ so that they may raise up seed to God in the land of promise.
1Ne 7:2	God gave us a new task.  My brothers and I^ needed to return again to Jerusalem to invite Ishmael and his family to join us  on this journey. 
1Ne 7:3	So again, my brothers^ and I journeyed to Jerusalem.  
1Ne 7:4	We traveled to the house of Ishmael.  Ishmael received us with kindness. We shared^ with him what God had commanded. 
1Ne 7:5	God softened Ishmael's heart.  God softened the hearts of the members of Ishmael's family.  The entire household of Ishmael agreed to join us to go into the wilderness to the tent of my father.
1Ne 7:6	As we journeyed^   to the tent of my father, discord erupted.  On one side was Laman and Lemuel, two of the daughters of Ishmael, and two sons of Ishmael (with their respective families).  On the other side was me (Nephi), Sam, Ishmael (and his wife), and three other daughters of Ishmael.  They did confront us.  
1Ne 7:7	They rebelled because they wanted to go back to Jerusalem.
1Ne 7:8	I was pained^ to see the hardness of their hearts.  I spoke to Laman and Lemuel: \Nephi{``You are my older brothers.  How is it that I, your younger brother have to speak to you?  How is it that I have to set an example for you? How is it that you harden your hearts?  How is it that you are so blind in your minds?''}
1Ne 7:9	\Nephi{``How is it that you don't listen to God?''}
1Ne 7:10	\Nephi{``How is it that you have forgotten that you have seen an angel of God^?''}
1Ne 7:11	\Nephi{``How is it that you have forgotten the great things God already has done for us?  God delivered us out of the hands of Laban.  We obtained the records as God had promised.''}
1Ne 7:12	\Nephi{``How is it that you have forgotten that God is able to do anything He desires?  God will prevail.  If we have faith in God, He will enable us to also succeed.  Wherefore, let us be faithful to God.''}
1Ne 7:13	\Nephi{``If we are faithful to God, we will also obtain the^ land of promise.  In the future, you will know that God's word was fulfilled regarding the destruction of Jerusalem.  All things which God has spoken must be fulfilled.  And so, Jerusalem will be destroyed.''}
1Ne 7:14	\Nephi{``The Spirit will soon not dwell with the people of Jerusalem.  They have rejected the prophets.  They have put Jeremiah^ in prison.  They desired to kill our father Lehi.  This compelled Lehi to leave Jerusalem.''}  
1Ne 7:15	\Nephi{``I tell you that if you go back, you will perish with the people of Jerusalem.  If you want, go back to Jerusalem, but remember what I said.  If you go, you will perish.  The Spirit compels me to tell you this.''} 
1Ne 7:16	After I spoke these things, my brothers got angry with me.  They seized me in their anger.  They tied me up with cords (both hands and feet).  They wanted^  to kill me.  They planned to leave me bound in the wilderness to be eaten by wild beasts. 
1Ne 7:17	I prayed^ to God: \Nephi{``God, according to my faith, deliver me from the hands of my brothers.  Give me strength that I may break these cords to free myself!''}
1Ne 7:18	When I finished my prayer, the cords broke and I was freed.  I got up.  Again I spoke to my brothers.
1Ne 7:19	And again, my brothers got angry with me.  Again, they wanted to seize me.  However, others in the group interceded.  One of the daughters of Ishmael^, her mother, and one of the sons of Ishmael spoke on my behalf.  They appealed^ to my brothers, softened their hearts, and persuaded them to stop going down this angry path. 
1Ne 7:20	My brothers calmed down.  They realized what they wanted to do was wicked.  They were sorry.  They did bow down before me and begged for my forgiveness. 
1Ne 7:21	Without reservation, I genuinely forgave them.  I encouraged them to also pray to God and ask Him for forgiveness.  And they did.  After they finished praying to God, we again continued our journey towards the tent of our father.
1Ne 7:22	We arrived safely at the tent of my father. Together, Ishmael and Lehi gave thanks to God.  Together, they did offer^  sacrifice and burnt^ offerings to God.
1Ne 8:1	In the wilderness, we gathered^ together seeds of all kinds.  We gathered seeds of every grain.  We gathered seeds of every fruit. 
1Ne 8:2	My father had another vision.  He told us: \Lehi{``I have dreamed a dream.''}
1Ne 8:3	\Lehi{``The vision gives me reason to rejoice.  I praise God to learn that my two sons, Nephi and Sam, will be saved.  I suppose from what I saw that many of their seed will also be saved.''}
1Ne 8:4	\Lehi{``The vision also gives me reason to grieve.  I fear exceedingly for Laman and Lemuel.  In my dream, I saw them lost in a dark and dreary wilderness.''} 
1Ne 8:5	\Lehi{``In my vision, I saw a man.  This man was dressed in a white robe.  He came and stood before me.''}
1Ne 8:6	\Lehi{``He spoke to me and asked me to follow him.''}
1Ne 8:7	\Lehi{``And I followed him.  I was in a dark and dreary wilderness.''} 
1Ne 8:8	\Lehi{``After I had traveled^ for many hours in the dark, I began to pray.  I prayed that God would have mercy on me.  I know God can be compassionate.''} 
1Ne 8:9	\Lehi{``After I prayed to God, I arrived at a large and spacious field.''}
1Ne 8:10	\Lehi{``I also saw a fruit-bearing tree.  I perceived that the fruit was desirable.  I perceived that eating the fruit would make one happy.''}
1Ne 8:11	\Lehi{``I walked towards the tree.  I ate the fruit.  It was very sweet.  It was sweeter than any fruit I ever had tasted before.  The fruit was white in color.  It was whiter than anything I had ever seen before.''}
1Ne 8:12	\Lehi{``As I ate of the fruit, it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy.  Therefore, I wanted my family to eat of the fruit.  I wanted them to experience the joy I experienced.  I knew this fruit was more desirable than all other fruit.''}
1Ne 8:13	\Lehi{``And I looked around.  I searched for my family.  While searching, I saw a river of water.  This river ran near the fruit tree.''} 
1Ne 8:14	\Lehi{``I looked upstream.  At the head^ of the river, I saw Sariah, Sam, and Nephi.  They stood around confused as to where they should go.''}
1Ne 8:15	\Lehi{``I motioned to them.  I cried out to them.  I wanted them to come and eat of the desirable fruit.''}
1Ne 8:16	\Lehi{``And they came to me.  They came to the tree.  They ate of the fruit.''}
1Ne 8:17	\Lehi{``I also wanted Laman and Lemuel to eat of the fruit.  I searched for them. Looking toward the head of the river, I spotted them.''}
1Ne 8:18	\Lehi{``I beckoned to them, but they would not come to the tree.''} 
1Ne 8:19	\Lehi{``Along the bank of the river, I saw a rod of iron.  The rod of iron led to the tree.''}  
1Ne 8:20	\Lehi{``I also saw a distressingly^ narrow path.  This path ran adjacent to the rod of iron from the head of the river to the tree.  The path continued into a large and spacious field.  This field was so large, it was as if it was a world.''} 
1Ne 8:21	\Lehi{``I saw uncountable assemblies of people in this field.  Some were searching for a path that would lead them to the tree where I stood.''}
1Ne 8:22	\Lehi{``And many commenced on the path which led to the tree.''}
1Ne 8:23	\Lehi{``And a mist^ of darkness arose in the field. This mist create exceedingly great darkness. Many lost their way because of the darkness.  They wandered off and were lost.''}
1Ne 8:24	\Lehi{``Others were able to grab the end of the rod^ of iron.  They did cling to the rod of iron.  They pressed forward in the mist of darkness.  They successfully reached the tree.  They ate of the fruit.''}  
1Ne 8:25	\Lehi{``After eating the fruit, [many] looked around as if they felt ashamed for eating it.''}  
1Ne 8:26	\Lehi{``On the other side of the river, I saw a building.  This building was great and spacious.  It stood high above the earth.  It stood as if^ it was in the air.''}  
1Ne 8:27	\Lehi{``And the building was filled with people.  Some were young.  Some were old.  Some were male.  Some were female.  They were all dressed with exceedingly fine apparel.  They pointed their fingers at those who arrived at^ the tree.  They pointed their fingers to mock those who ate of the fruit.''}
1Ne 8:28	\Lehi{``Many felt unworthy as they were mocked by the finely-dressed people in the building.  They felt^ ashamed.  They fell away^ on strange paths.  They were lost.''}  
1Ne 8:29	I (Nephi) will not write down everything my father said. 
1Ne 8:30	In summary, he saw other multitudes pressing forward.  They came and grabbed the end of the rod of iron.  They pressed forward holding fast to the rod of iron.  When they arrived at the tree, they fell to their knees.  They ate of the tree.
1Ne 8:31	Other multitudes directed themselves in the darkness to the great and spacious building.
1Ne 8:32	Many were drowned in the depths of the river.  Many others were lost from my father's view.  They wandered off onto strange roads.
1Ne 8:33	A great many multitudes entered into the strange^ building. After they entered into the building [and being dressed with fine clothing], they would point their fingers and mock those of us who were eating of the tree.  We heeded them not.
1Ne 8:34	Lehi said: \Lehi{``If a person ate the fruit, and was ashamed, they would fall away onto strange roads and be lost.''}
1Ne 8:35	Lehi also said:  \Lehi{``Laman and Lemuel did not^ eat of the fruit.''} 
1Ne 8:36	My father described in great detail the many things he saw in his vision.  After, he said:  \Lehi{``I fear for you Laman and Lemuel.  This vision worries me.  I exceedingly fear that you will be cast off from the presence of God.''}
1Ne 8:37	Lehi exhorted them.  He wanted them to listen to his words.  He wanted God to have mercy on them.  He didn't want God to cast them out.  With genuine feelings of a caring parent, Lehi preached to them.
1Ne 8:38	After he preached to them, he prophesied to them many things.  He asked them to keep God's commandments.  [Finally,] he stopped speaking.
1Ne 9:1	All of these things^ happened as my father Lehi dwelt in a tent in the valley of Lemuel.  Lehi saw, heard, and said much.  I can't write them all on these plates.  There is not enough space.
1Ne 9:2	These small plates do not contain a full account of the history of my people.  I have created other plates that have the full account.  I call them the plates of Nephi.  These small plates^ I also call the plates of Nephi.
1Ne 9:3	God commanded me that these small plates have a special purpose.  The purpose is the provide a spiritual account of the ministry^ of my people.
1Ne 9:4	On the large plates of Nephi, my seed should write an account of our secular history.  The large plates should contain the history of the reign of kings, the wars and contentions of my people.  These small plates are for the more part about the spiritual ministry.  The large plates are for the more part about the reign of kings and the wars and contentions of my people.
1Ne 9:5	Therefore, God commanded me to make these small plates.  I do not know why He wants me to make these small plates; however, I know God is wise.  God has a reason He wants me to write these things.
1Ne 9:6	God knows all things from the beginning.  God prepares a way that all of His works will be accomplished among the children of men.  God has all power to fulfill all of His word.  And thus it is^.  Amen.
1Ne 10:1	I (Nephi) will proceed to give an account of my reign and ministry^ on these small plates.  Before proceeding, however, there are a few more things I need to share about my father and my brothers.
1Ne 10:2	My father finished telling us about his vision.  He next exhorted my brothers to be faithful and diligent.  He then spoke about the Jews^ in Jerusalem.
1Ne 10:3	Lehi told us that the Jews will be destroyed.  The great city of Jerusalem will be destroyed.  After the destruction, many will be carried away captive into Babylon.  According to the timing of God, the Jews will one day return to Jerusalem.  Yes, God will bring them back out of captivity.  Then, the Jews will again possess the land of their^ inheritance. 
1Ne 10:4	Six hundred years after Lehi left Jerusalem, God will send a prophet to the Jewish nation in their land of inheritance.  This prophet will be the Messiah, a Savior of the world.
1Ne 10:5	Lehi taught us that a great number of prophets had testified that a Messiah would come.  This Messiah would redeem this world.
1Ne 10:6	Lehi taught that all mankind are in a lost and fallen state.  They need a Redeemer to save them from this state.
1Ne 10:7	Lehi spoke about another prophet that would precede the Messiah.  This prophet will prepare the way for the Messiah.
1Ne 10:8	This prophet^ will go into the wilderness and preach: \JohnB{``Prepare the way for the coming of the Messiah.  Make a righteous path for Him.  He will stand among you and you will not know him.  He is mightier than I.  I am not worthy to loosen the strap of His sandals.''}  Lehi said much about this prophet.
1Ne 10:9	This prophet will baptize people in the river Jordan.  He will baptize on the far side^ of the river at Bethabara (Joshua's crossing).  This prophet will baptize by immersion in the water.  This prophet will also baptize^ the Messiah in the water. 
1Ne 10:10	After this prophet baptizes the Messiah in the water, he will look the Messiah in the eye and bear record that he just baptized the Lamb of God.  This Messiah will take sin^ away from the world.
1Ne 10:11	After sharing this, Lehi taught my brothers about the gospel which the Messiah preached among the Jews.  The Jews did not believe this gospel.  They Jews killed their Messiah.  Yet, the Messiah would rise from the dead.  Although the Jews did not believe, over time, the Gentiles would believe the story of the resurrected Messiah.  The Gentiles would come to believe by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
1Ne 10:12	Lehi spoke a lot about the Gentiles.  He spoke a lot about the house of Israel.  The house of Israel is like an olive tree whose branches^ are broken off and scattered across the earth.  
1Ne 10:13	Lehi said that it is God's will that we should be led together as a family to the land of promise.  This fulfills the word of God: \God{``The house of Israel will be scattered across the earth''.}
1Ne 10:14	After being scattered, the house of Israel will again be gathered together.  This will happen after the Gentiles receive the fullness of the gospel.  That is, one day these scattered natural branches of the olive tree (remnants of the house of Israel) will be grafted^ back into the true olive tree.  This means the house of Israel will come to the knowledge of the true Messiah as their Lord and Redeemer. 
1Ne 10:15	Thus my father prophesied to my brothers.  He also shared many more things which I do not write on these small plates.  I have written many of these other^ things on the larger plates of Nephi.
1Ne 10:16	All of this transpired as my father dwelt in a tent in the valley of Lemuel.
1Ne 10:17	I reflected on the words of my father.  I pondered what he had shared about his vision of the tree.  I also pondered the things my father had explained.  He spoke by the power of the Holy Ghost.  He received this power because of his faith in the Son of God.  The Son of God was this Messiah that will come.  I wanted to see and hear and know these things for myself.  \Nephi{``The power of the Holy Ghost is a gift from God to all those that diligently seek Him.  This gift is given to all who diligently seek the Messiah.  Yes, in times of old, this gift was given. In my time, this gift^ is given.  In future times (such as when the Messiah will manifest himself unto the children of men), this gift will be given.''}
1Ne 10:18	\Nephi{``God is the same yesterday, today, and forever.  The way to salvation was prepared for all men before the foundation of the world.  If men will turn to God, they will be saved.''}
1Ne 10:19	\Nephi{``Those who seek God diligently will find Him.  The empheries of God will be revealed to them by the power of the Holy Ghost.  In old times, in my times, and in times to come, God's ways do not change.  God's course is one eternal round.''}
1Ne 10:20	\Nephi{``All mankind needs to remember this.  We will be judged based on the things we do.''}
1Ne 10:21	\Nephi{``If you spend your life doing wicked things, you will be found unclean at the judgement seat of God.  Unclean things cannot dwell with God.  Therefore, you will be cast off forever.''}
1Ne 10:22	\Nephi{``I cannot deny these things.  This is why I speak them to you.  The Holy Ghost has given me authority to do so.''}
1Ne 11:1	I (Nephi) wanted to know for myself about the things my father Lehi had seen.  I believed that God could make them known to me.  As I sat^ pondering these things in my heart, I was caught away in Spirit to an exceedlingly high mountain.  I had never seen this mountain before.  I had never set foot on this mountain before.
1Ne 11:2	The Spirit asked me: \Spirit{``What do you want?''}
1Ne 11:3	I answered: \Nephi{``I want to see the things which my father has seen.''}
1Ne 11:4	The Spirit asked me: \Spirit{``Do you believe that your father saw a tree as he explained?''}
1Ne 11:5	I answered: \Nephi{``Yes, You know that I believe all the words of my father.''}
1Ne 11:6	The Spirit responded, crying with a loud voice: \Spirit{``Glory to the Most High God.  He is God over all the earth.  He is above all.  You are blessed Nephi because you believe in the Son of the Most High God.  Therefore, you will see the things you have desired.''}
1Ne 11:7	\Spirit{``As a token of God's goodness, I will show you the vision of the tree that your father did see.  You will see the fruit of this tree that your father did taste.  I will also^ show you a man descend from heaven.  You will witness what you see.  You will declare that this man is the Son of God.''}
1Ne 11:8	The Spirit said:  \Spirit{``Look!''}  And I looked.  I saw the tree.  It was like the tree my father saw.  It was beautiful, exceedlingly beautiful.  The fruit had a white color.  The whiteness of the fruit exceeded the whiteness of driven snow^.
1Ne 11:9	After I saw the tree, I said to the Spirit: \Nephi{``I see this tree you have shown me.  It is precious above all.''}
1Ne 11:10	The Spirit asked:  \Spirit{``What would you like to know?''}  
1Ne 11:11	I answered: \Nephi{``I want to know what this vision means?  What is the interpretation of the tree?''}  I spoke to him as I would speak to a mortal man.  He was in the form of a man; nevertheless, I knew he was the Spirit of God.  He spake to me as any man would speak to me.
1Ne 11:12	The Spirit said: \Spirit{``Look!''} And I looked.  I looked toward Him, but He was gone.  He had disappeared from my presence.
1Ne 11:13	I looked and saw the great city of Jerusalem.  I also saw other cities.  I saw the city of Nazareth.  In the city of Nazareth, I saw a virgin.  She was very pretty.  She was exceedlingly white^. 
1Ne 11:14	I next saw the heavens open.  An angel came down from heaven.  He stood before me.  The angel asked: \Angel{``Nephi, what do you see?''}
1Ne 11:15	I answered:  \Nephi{``I see a virgin. A woman that is most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.''}
1Ne 11:16	And the angel asked: \Angel{``Do you understand the condescension^  of God?''} 
1Ne 11:17	I answered: \Nephi{``I know that He loves His children. Nevertheless, I don't know the meaning of all things.''}
1Ne 11:18	The angel said: \Angel{``Behold the virgin you see is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.''} 
1Ne 11:19	I saw that she was carried^ away in the Spirit.  Some time thereafter the angel said: \Angel{``Look!'}
1Ne 11:20	And I looked.  I saw the virgin again. She was carrying a child in her arms.
1Ne 11:21	And the angel said: \Angel{``This is the Lamb of God.  He is the Son^ of the Eternal Father!''}  The angel then asked: \Angel{``Do you understand the meaning of the tree which your father did see?''}
1Ne 11:22	I answered: \Nephi{``I do.  The tree represents the love of God.  His love diffuses throughout the world into the hearts of the children of men.  God's love is the most desirable thing.''} 
1Ne 11:23	The angel said: \Angel{``Yes indeed.  The love of God is the most desirable thing.  It gives the most joy to the soul.''}
1Ne 11:24	The angel again said: \Angel{``Look!''} And I looked.  I saw the Son of God going forth among the children of men.  I saw many people fall down at His feet and worship Him.
1Ne 11:25	I also saw the rod of iron which my father had seen.  The rod of iron represents the word of God.  On one end, this rod of iron led to the fountain^ of living waters.  On the other end, this rod of iron led to the tree of life.  Both the living waters and the tree of life represent the love of God.
1Ne 11:26	And the angel again said \Angel{``Look! Behold the condescension of God!''}
1Ne 11:27	And I looked.  And I saw the Redeemer of the world my father had talked about.  I also saw the prophet that would prepare the way for Him.  This prophet baptized^ the Lamb of God.  After He was baptized, I saw the heavens open.  The Holy Ghost descended from heaven (in the form of a dove) and dwelled with Him.
1Ne 11:28	I saw the Lamb of God minister to the people with power and great glory.  Multitudes gathered together to listen to Him.  I also saw that some cast Him out of their presence.
1Ne 11:29	I also saw twelve others who followed Him.  These twelve were carried away in the Spirit.  I looked toward them, but they were gone.  They had disappeared from my presence.
1Ne 11:30	Again the angel spoke: \Angel{``Look!''} And I looked.  I saw the heavens open again.  I saw^ angels descending from heaven to minister to the children of men.
1Ne 11:31	The angel said: \Angel{``Look!''} And I looked.  I saw the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men.  I saw multitudes of people.  Some were sick.  Some were afflicted with all manner of diseases.  Some were possessed with unclean spirits.  The angel spoke and showed me these things.  All of these afflicted people were healed by the power of the Lamb of God.  And by the power of the Lamb of God, the unclean spirits were cast out.
1Ne 11:32	And again the angel spoke to me saying: \Angel{``Look!''} And I looked.  I saw the Lamb of God.  I saw that He was arrested by His people (the Jews).  The Son of the everlasting Father was judged by the world.  I saw this.  I bear witness^ to what I saw.
1Ne 11:33	I (Nephi) saw that the Lamb of God was lifted up on a cross and slain^ for the sins of the world. 
1Ne 11:34	After He was slain, I saw multitudes of the earth.  They gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb.  (The angel of the Lord called the twelve I saw in my vision \emph{apostles}.)
1Ne 11:35	I saw multitudes of the earth gather together.  I saw that they were in a large and spacious building, like the building my father saw.  The angel spoke again saying: \Angel{``Behold the world and the wisdom thereof! Yes, the house of Israel has united with the world and its wisdom.  Together, they gather to fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.''}
1Ne 11:36	The great and spacious building represents the pride of the world.  I saw it fall.  I saw that its fall was exceedlingly^ great.  I saw these things.  I bear witness to what I saw.  The angel again spoke to me saying: \Angel{``Many will fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.  Nations, kindreds, tongues and people will fight them.  And those that fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb  will be destroyed.  Their fall will be great.''}
1Ne 12:1	Again, the angel spoke: \Angel{``Look!  Behold your seed!  Behold the seed of your brothers!''}  And I looked.  I saw the land of promise.  I saw multitudes^ of people.  There were a lot of people.  They numbered as many as the sands^ of the sea.  
1Ne 12:2	I saw multitudes gather together to battle.  One multitude would fight another.  I saw wars and rumors of wars.  I saw much death.  My people killed^ and were killed with the sword.
1Ne 12:3	I saw many generations.  There were many wars.  There were many contentions in the land.  I saw many cities.  There were so many cities, I did not count^ them.  
1Ne 12:4	I saw a darkness fill the air in this land of promise.  I saw lightnings.  I heard thunderings, earthquakes, and many other loud, tumultuous noises.  Rocks were torn asunder.  The earth broke apart.  Fissures formed.  I saw mountains tumble into pieces.  I saw the plains of the earth break up.  I saw many cities sink into the sea.  I saw many cities burn with fire.  I saw many cities collapse into the earth because of the quaking. 
1Ne 12:5	This destructive activites were the great and terrible judgments of God.  After seeing this events, I saw the vapor of darkness dissipate from the air.  I saw those multitudes that survived^ the destruction.   
1Ne 12:6	I saw the heavens open.  I saw the Lamb of God descend out of heaven. I saw Him appear before those that survived the calamities.
1Ne 12:7	I also saw that He chose twelve from among my people.  He ordained them.  He gave them the power^ of the Holy Ghost.  I saw this.  I bear witness to what I saw.
1Ne 12:8	And the angel spoke: \Angel{``Behold the twelve disciples of the Lamb of God!  They are chosen to minister to your seed.''}
1Ne 12:9	And the angel said: \Angel{``Remember the twelve apostles of the Lamb of God?  They will judge the twelve tribes of Israel.  The twelve ministers of your seed will also be judged by the twelve apostles.  You and your seed are also descendants of the house of Israel.''}
1Ne 12:10	\Angel{``These twelve ministers of your seed will judge your seed.  They are righteous^ forever.  Because of their faith in the Lamb of God, their garments are made white^ in His blood.''}  
1Ne 12:11	And the angel spoke: \Angel{``Look!''} And I looked.  I saw three generations^ pass in righteousness.  Their garments were white even like the garments of the Lamb of God.  And the angel said: \Angel{``Because of their faith in the Lamb of God, their garments are made white in His blood.''}
1Ne 12:12	I (Nephi) saw the fourth generation.  Many of this generation also passed away in righteousness.  
1Ne 12:13	I saw that the multitudes gathered together again.
1Ne 12:14	And the angel spoke: \Angel{``Behold your seed!  Behold the seed of your brothers!''}
1Ne 12:15	And I looked.  I saw the people of my seed gathered together in multitudes against the seed of my brothers.  They were gathered for battle.
1Ne 12:16	And the angel spoke: \Angel{``Behold the fountain of filthy water which your father saw!  This river of filth is deep.  Indeed, the depths of this river are the depths of hell.''}
1Ne 12:17	\Angel{``And the mists of darkness are the temptations of the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  These mists blind a man's eyes.  These mists harden a man's heart.  These mists lead a man away onto strange roads.  Because of these mists, many of the children of men perish and are lost.''}
1Ne 12:18	\Angel{``And the large and spacious building your father saw represents the vain imaginations^ and pride of the children of men. Those in the large and spacious building are divided from those at the tree of life.  They are divided by a great and terrible gulf.  This division represents the sword of justice^ of the Eternal Father.  The Lamb of God represents the Messiah.  The Holy Ghost bears witness of this truth.  This has been God's way since before the foundation of the world.  This is God's way now.  And this will be God's way henceforth and forever more.''}
1Ne 12:19	And while the angel was speaking, I saw conflict.  The seed of my brothers contended against my seed just as the angel had foretold.  My seed had fallen from their faith in God.  They were filled with proud.  They gave in to the temptations of the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  As a result, I saw that the seed of my brothers did overpower the people^ of my seed.  
1Ne 12:20	Indeed, I saw the seed of my brothers overpower the people of my seed. In fact, they destroyed my seed.  Thereafter, the seed of my brothers went forth in multitudes upon the face of this promised land.
1Ne 12:21	I saw them gather together in multitudes.  Among them, I saw wars and rumors of wars.  This tradition of warring continued for many generations.
1Ne 12:22	And the angel spoke: \Angel{``Behold the seed of your brothers have dwindled in unbelief!''}
1Ne 12:23	And I saw that this was true.  They had dwindled in unbelief.  They had become dark^.  They had become loathsome.  They had become a filthy people.  There were full of idleness.  They did all manner of abominations.
1Ne 13:1	The angel^ spoke: \Angel{``Look!''}  And I looked.  I saw many nations.  I saw many kingdoms.
1Ne 13:2	The angel asked: \Angel{``What do you see?''}  And I answered: \Nephi{``I see many nations.  I see many kingdoms.''}
1Ne 13:3	The angel responded: \Angel{``Yes.  These are the nations^ and kingdoms of the Gentiles.''}
1Ne 13:4	I saw that a great church was^ formed.  I saw that it was formed among the nations of the Gentiles.  
1Ne 13:5	And the angel spoke: \Angel{``Behold the formation of an abominable church!  This church is the most abominable of all other churches.  This church kills the saints of God.  This church tortures them.  This church oppresses them.  This church yokes them with chains.  This church enslaves them.''}
1Ne 13:6	I saw this great and abominable church.  I saw that the church was founded by the {\wicked{wicked one}}.
1Ne 13:7	I also saw gold, silver, silks, scarlets, fine-twined linen, and all manner of precious clothing.  I also saw many harlots.
1Ne 13:8	And the angel spoke: \Angel{``Behold these things are the desires of this great and abominable church.''}
1Ne 13:9	\Angel{``Worldly power motivates those in the abominable church.  They seek praise of the world.  This is why they kill the saints of God.  This is why they enslave^ the saints of God.''}  
1Ne 13:10	And I looked.  I saw \emph{many waters}^.  And these waters divided the Gentiles from the seed of my brothers.
1Ne 13:11	And the angel spoke: \Angel{``Behold the wrath of God!  It will descend upon the seed of your brothers.''}
1Ne 13:12	And I looked.  I saw a man^ among the Gentiles.  The Spirit of God descended upon this man.  He traveled from the land of the Gentiles to this promised land.  He traveled across the \emph{many waters} to the seed of my brothers. 
1Ne 13:13	I also saw the Spirit of God descend upon other Gentiles.  God inspired them to travel across the \emph{many waters} to this land of promised.  These Gentiles traveled to escape subjection^ from the kingdoms of the Gentiles. 
1Ne 13:14	I saw many multitudes of Gentiles living in the land of promise.  I saw the wrath of God descend upon the seed of my brothers.  I saw the Gentiles scatter the seed of my brothers.  I saw the Gentiles kill many^ of the seed of my brothers.
1Ne 13:15	And I saw the Spirit of God was with the Gentiles.  God blessed them with prosperity.  The Gentiles obtained this promised land as their land of inheritance.  I saw that the Gentiles were white^. I saw that the Gentiles were exceedingly fair and beautiful.  This countenance was similar to my people before they perished. 
1Ne 13:16	I saw the Gentiles escape subjection.  These liberated^ Gentiles were humbled by their freedom and prosperity.  They humbled themselves before God.  And the power of God was with them.
1Ne 13:17	The mother^ nations and kingdoms gathered together to battle against the liberated Gentiles living in the promised land. They gathered forces upon the \emph{many waters}.  They gathered forces upon the land.
1Ne 13:18	I saw the power of God was with the liberated^ Gentiles living in the promised land.  The wrath of God descended upon the mother nations and kingdoms gathered together to battle against them.
1Ne 13:19	I saw that God was with the liberated Gentiles.  Delivered^ by the power of God, they defeated all of their enemies.  
1Ne 13:20	I saw that these people^ did prosper in the land.  And I saw that they carried a book with them.
1Ne 13:21	And the angel asked: \Angel{``Do you understand what this book is?''}
1Ne 13:22	And I answered: \Nephi{``I do not.''}
1Ne 13:23	And the angel responded: \Angel{``This book came from^ the Jews.''}  And I saw the book and understood.  The book contains the record of the Jews.  The book includes the covenants of God, all of the promises He mad to the house of Israel.  The book also includes many of the prophecies of the holy prophets.  These prophetic writings were similar to the records we have on the brass plates.  Our records are more comprehensive.  Nonetheless, the book contains^ the covenants between God and the house of Israel.  As a result, the book is very important and valuable to the Gentiles.  
1Ne 13:24	And the angel spoke: \Angel{``This book came from the Jews.  The twelve apostles truly shared the gospel in this^ book.  When initially shared, the book contained the fullness of the gospel of the Lamb of God.''}    
1Ne 13:25	\Angel{``The contents of the book were pure and true when first written by the prophets and apostles.''}  
1Ne 13:26	\Angel{``The twelve apostles of the Lamb of God wrote many things that were originally included in the book.  After the apostles wrote these things, the great and abominable church was formed. This church is the most abominable of all other churches.  This church took away many parts of the gospel of the Lamb of God from this book.  Many plain and precious truths were removed from the book.  Many of God's covenants were also removed from the book.''}
1Ne 13:27	\Angel{``Leaders of this abominable church removed these things^  with purpose.  They wanted to pervert God's truths.  They wanted to blind the eyes and harden the hearts of the children of men.''}
1Ne 13:28	\Angel{``The book you see is the true book of the Lamb of God after it passed through the hands of the great and abominable church.''}
1Ne 13:29	\Angel{``Many plain and precious things were removed^ from the book by the great and abominable church. Because of these omissions, the {\wicked{wicked one}} has great power over the Gentiles.  Many do stumble as a result.  This abominable church disseminated the altered book to all^ nations of the Gentiles.  The liberated Gentiles brought it with them across the many waters.''} 
1Ne 13:30	\Angel{``This land of promise is a choice land above all other lands.  God covenanted that your father and his seed should have this^ land as an inheritance.  Additionally, God blessed the liberated Gentiles and they also obtained this land.  Lifted up by the power of God, the liberated Gentiles are above all other^ nations.  Because of God's covenants, He will not allow the liberated Gentiles to wipe out your seed, which is mixed among those of the seed of your brothers.''}  
1Ne 13:31	\Angel{``Neither will God allow the liberated Gentiles to destroy the seed of your brothers.''}
1Ne 13:32	\Angel{``Neither will God allow the liberated^  Gentiles to remain forever blind to God's truths.  They are blinded because the plain and precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb of God were kept back by this abominable church.''} 
1Ne 13:33	\Angel{``The Lamb of God promises:''} \Lamb{``I will be merciful unto the Gentiles.  In great judgment, I will cause the Gentiles to be a scourge to the remnant of the house of Israel.''}
1Ne 13:34	\Lamb{``This remnant includes^ the seed of your father.  This remnant will be subdued by the Gentiles.  Remember, these Gentiles also stumble because of the abominable church.  This church (the mother of harlots) withheld many plain and precious truths from my gospel.  After the seed of your father is subdued in great judgment, I will then be merciful to the Jews. That is, in My power, I will bring forth again much of My gospel.  I will bring forth many of the plain and precious truths.''}
1Ne 13:35	\Lamb{``I will also show myself to your seed.  And your seed will write many things when I will minister to them.  These writing will contain the plain and precious truths of My gospel.  After your seed dwindles in unbelief, your seed will be destroyed.  Before your seed is destroyed, these writings will be hid up by My power.  I will gift these writings to the liberated Gentiles.''}
1Ne 13:36	\Lamb{``And these writings will contain My Gospel.''}  \Angel{``These are the words of the Lamb of God: our rock and salvation^.''} 
1Ne 13:37	\Angel{``Blessed are those^ who will bring forth these writings and establish Zion.  God will bless them with the gift and power of the Holy Ghost.  If they endure to the end, they will be saved.  They will be lifted up at the last day and saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb of God.  Their efforts to publish and share the gospel of peace and salvation will be found to be beautiful^ by those dwelling upon the mountains.''} 
1Ne 13:38	I (Nephi) saw the remnant of the seed of my brothers.  I also saw the book of the Lamb of God.  The Gentiles shared this book with the remnant of the seed of my brothers. 
1Ne 13:39	I saw other^ books.  These books also came forth by the power of God.  The Gentiles shared these books with the remnant of the seed of my brothers.  God will bring forth many records to convince the Jews, the Gentiles, and the remnant of the seed of my brothers.  God wants to convince them that the words of the prophets and twelve apostles are true.
1Ne 13:40	And the angel^ spoke:  \Angel{``These last records will^ establish the truth of the first records.  These records you have seen among the Gentiles.  They contain the writings of the twelve apostles of the Lamb of God.  God's truths will be known. The plain and precious things that were removed will be known.  All kindreds, tongues, and people will know that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father.  He is the Savior of the world.  All men will know that they must turn to the Lamb of God or they cannot be saved. ''} 
1Ne 13:41	\Angel{``All men must come to the Lamb of God according to the words ratified by the Lamb of God.  He ratifies the last records of your seed.  He ratifies the first records of the twelve apostles.  These writings will be set together as one.  For there is one God.  For there is one Shepherd over all the earth.''}
1Ne 13:42	\Angel{``The Lamb of God will show Himself to all nations.  A time will come when He will first show Himself to the Jews and then the Gentiles.  Another time will come when He will first show Himself to the Gentiles and then to the Jews.  The last shall be first.  The first^ shall be last.''}
1Ne 14:1	(The angel continued:) \Angel{``The Lamb of God will manifest Himself in word, in power, and in very deed.  If the Gentiles will hearken to these manifestations, He will take away their stumbling blocks.''}  
1Ne 14:2	\Angel{``If they do not harden their hearts against the Lamb of God, they will be blessed.  They will forever remain free in the promised land.  They will be numbered among the house of Israel.  They will also be numbered among the seed of your father.  The house of Israel will be confounded^ no more.''}
1Ne 14:3	\Angel{``The great and abominable church was founded by the {\wicked{wicked one}} and his followers to confound men.  They want to led their souls to hell.  Hell is a great pit dug by the {\wicked{wicked one}} and his followers to destroy men. (Not the everlasting destruction of the soul, but the casting down into hell that has no end.)  One day, the pit (hell) will be filled by those who participated in digging it.''}
1Ne 14:4	\Angel{``The {\wicked{wicked one}} ensnares men into the great pit of captivity.  Hell is assigned according to the justice of God.  All those who do wicked abominations before God will be cast into hell.''}
1Ne 14:5	Again, the angel spoke: \Angel{``You have seen that if the Gentiles repent, it will be well with them.  You also know about God's covenants with the house of Israel.  If one repents, he will not perish.''}
1Ne 14:6	\Angel{``Therefore, wo unto the Gentiles if they harden their hearts against the Lamb of God!''}
1Ne 14:7	\Angel{``The Lamb of God declared:''} \Lamb{``A time will come when I will perform a great and marvelous work among the children of men.  This work will be everlasting. Either a man will find the peace of life eternal or he will not.  If not, it will be because of man's blindness in his mind.  The man will harden his heart.  And doing so, he will deliver himself as a captive of the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  This will lead to his spirititual and temporal destruction.''}
1Ne 14:8	After speaking these things, the angel asked: \Angel{``Do you remember God's covenants^ He made with the house of Israel?''} And I answered: \Nephi{``Yes.''}
1Ne 14:9	And the angel said: \Angel{``Look!''} And I looked. I saw the great and abominable church.  This church is the mother of abominations.  The founder of this church is the {\wicked{wicked one}}.
1Ne 14:10	And the angel said: \Angel{``Behold, there are only^ two churches.  One is the church of the Lamb of God.  The other is the church of the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  If you do not belong to the church of the Lamb of God, this means you belong to the other church.  The other \emph{great} church is the mother of abominations and is the whore of all the earth.''}
1Ne 14:11	And I looked and saw this church.  She sat upon \emph{many waters}^.  She had dominion over all the earth.  She was the whore of the entire earth.  She had dominion over all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.  Her numbers were great.
1Ne 14:12	And I also looked and saw the church of the Lamb of God.  Its numbers were few because of the wicked abominations of the {\wicked{wicked one}}'s church.  The members of the church of the Lamb of God were few, but they were spread throughout the world.  Their dominions were small because the dominion of the {\wicked{wicked one}}'s church was so great.  Members of the church of the Lamb of God were called \emph{saints} of God.
1Ne 14:13	And I saw that the {\wicked{wicked one}}'s church did gather together in multitudes.  These multitudes came from all nations of the Gentiles.  They gathered together to fight against the Lamb of God.
1Ne 14:14	I saw the power of the Lamb of God descend upon the saints of God.  It descended upon the God's covenant people.  They had the glory of God with them.  This power armed them with righteousness.
1Ne 14:15	I saw the wrath of God descend upon the great and abominable church.  As a result there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth.
1Ne 14:16	There began to be wars and rumors of wars among all nations^ that belong to the mother of abominations.  And the angel spoke: \Angel{``The wrath of God^ is upon the mother of harlots, as you see!''}
1Ne 14:17	\Angel{``And the wrath of God will be poured out upon the mother of harlots, the great and abominable church of all the earth.  The church founded by the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  When wrath comes, the work of the Father^ will begin.  The way will be prepared for God to fulfill all covenants he promised to His people (the house of Israel).''}
1Ne 14:18	And the angel said: \Angel{``Look!''} 
1Ne 14:19	And I looked. I saw a man dressed in a white robe.
1Ne 14:20	And the angel said: \Angel{``Behold one of the twelve apostles of the Lamb of God!''} 
1Ne 14:21	\Angel{``This apostle will see and write the remainder of these things that are to come.  He will also see and write many things which have already happened.''}
1Ne 14:22	\Angel{``And he will write^ about the end of the world.''} 
1Ne 14:23	\Angel{``The things he will write are just and true.  They are written in a book^ which you saw proceeded from the Jews.  When it was first written, it contained things that were plain and pure.  Things that were most precious and easy for all men to understand.''}
1Ne 14:24	\Angel{``And this apostle of the Lamb of God will write many things you have already seen.  He will also write things you are about to see.''}
1Ne 14:25	\Angel{``God commands that you do not^ write down these things you are about to see.  God has ordained the apostle of the Lamb of God to do so.''}
1Ne 14:26	\Angel{``And like this apostle, others have been given a task to write all things they have seen.  Many of these written things are sealed up.  The knowledge will come forth in pure form according to the truth which is the Lamb of God.  They will be revealed to the house of Israel in God's own due time.''}
1Ne 14:27	And I (Nephi) heard these things.  I witness that these things are true.  The angel also told me the name of the apostle of the Lamb of God.  His name was John.
1Ne 14:28	And I was told not to write down the remainder of things I saw^ and heard.  What I have written is sufficient based on what God commanded.  I emphasize that I have written only a small part of the many things which I saw.
1Ne 14:29	I witnessed these things.  I saw the things my father saw.  An angel of God made them known to me.
1Ne 14:30	I conclude talking about this vision.  I saw many things while carried away in the Spirit.  Even though I did not write everything I saw, everything I wrote down is true. I seal this testimony with the word \emph{Amen}. 
1Ne 15:1	I (Nephi) had been carried away by the Spirit.  I saw many things.  After this vision, I returned to the tent of my father.
1Ne 15:2	I saw my brothers discussing the things my father had shared with them.  They were arguing about the meaning of these things.
1Ne 15:3	Truly, Lehi shared many great things with them.  Things that are difficult to understand.  A man can understand these things by asking God.  But my brothers had hardened their hearts.  They did not look to God for an understanding of these things.
1Ne 15:4	I was again grieved to see this.  My brothers had hardened^ their hearts.  I had seen in my vision that results of such wickedness.  Not just with my brothers, but with all of the children of men. 
1Ne 15:5	I was overwhelmed with the immensity of what I had seen.  I saw my people destroyed because they also hardened their hearts.   The knowledge of their ruin afflicted me tremendously.
1Ne 15:6	After regaining my internal^ fortitude, I asked my brothers why they were arguing.
1Ne 15:7	My brothers said: \Brothers{``We don't understand what our father said about the natural branches of the olive tree.  And the branches of the Gentiles?''}
1Ne 15:8	I responded: \Nephi{``Did you ask God to explain the meaning?''}
1Ne 15:9	My brothers^  retorted: \Brothers{``No, we did not ask God.  He does not make such things known to us.''}
1Ne 15:10	I responded: \Nephi{``Why won't you keep God's commandments?  Why do you harden your hearts?  Don't you know you will perish?''}
1Ne 15:11	\Nephi{``Don't you remember what God says?  Keep His commandments.  Ask His in faith.  Believe He will answer you.  Don't harden your hearts. If you do these things, certainly God will explain the meaning of these things.''}
1Ne 15:12	\Nephi{``Okay, I will tell you the meaning.  The house of Israel was compared to a tame olive tree.  The tribes and their descendants represent natural branches.  We (Lehi's family) are a branch of the house of Israel.  We are broken off from the rest of the olive tree.''}
1Ne 15:13	\Nephi{``The Gentiles represent a wild^ olive tree, not the original tree.  The Gentiles will receive the fullness of the gospel in the distant future.  This knowledge will be taught by them to the remnant of our branch.  Our branch will have dwindled in unbelief for many generations and many years after the Messiah came to earth in a mortal body.  Our remnant seed represents one natural branch that will be grafted in to the orginal olive tree in the last days.''}
1Ne 15:14	\Nephi{``The remnant of our seed (our natural branch) will regain knowledge of God.  They will know that they are a natural branch of the house of Israel that was broken off.  They will know they are the God's covenant people.  They will know about their forefathers (including us).  Most importantly, they will know about the gospel of the Redeemer of Israel.  They will know the Messiah ministered to their forefathers.  They will know the key points of His doctrine.  They will know how they can be save by coming to Him.''}
1Ne 15:15	\Nephi{``Won't the remnant of our seed rejoice knowing these things?  That God is their rock and their salvation?  Won't they receive strength and nourishment from the true vine?  Won't they join the true fold of God?''}
1Ne 15:16	\Nephi{``Yes indeed!  They will be numbered^ again among the house of Israel.  As a natural branch, they will be grafted back in.  The broken branch will be restored to the true olive tree.''}
1Ne 15:17	\Nephi{``This is what our father means. The Lamb of God will be rejected by the Jews (the house of Israel).  So He will show His power to the Gentiles.  The Gentiles will then scatter the remnant of our seed, but not destroy it.  One day, the Gentiles will teach this scattered remnant about the Lamb of God as the Redeemer of Israel.  This is the order things.  This is how our remnant will be restored to the house of Israel.''}
1Ne 15:18	\Brothers{``Remember, our father spoke of all of the house of Israel, not just our seed.  In the last days, God's covenant made to Abraham^ will be fulfilled.  God promised Abraham saying:''} \God{``In your seed will all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.''}
1Ne 15:19	And I (Nephi) explained many of these things to my brothers.  I described how the Jews would be restored in the last days.
1Ne 15:20	And I did recite many of the words of Isaiah to my brothers.  Isaiah explained how the Jews (more precisely the house of Israel) would be restored.  They would not longer be confounded, suppressed, or scattered again.  I explained many things to my brothers.  They seemed pacified and content with my response.  They humbled themselves before God.
1Ne 15:21	Later, my brothers returned with more^ questions: \Brothers{``What did our father's vision mean?  What does the tree mean that he saw in this vision?''}
1Ne 15:22	And I answered: \Nephi{``The tree is a representation of the tree of life.''}
1Ne 15:23	And my brothers asked another question: \Brothers{``What does the rod of iron mean that led to the tree?''}
1Ne 15:24	And I answered: \Nephi{``The rod is a representation of the word of God.  A man needs to listen to the word of God and hold on tightly to God's teachings.  If a man does this, he will never perish.  Temptations^ will not overpower him.  Fiery darts will not overpower him.  A man will not be blinded by the adversary.  He will not be led to his destruction by the adversary.''}
1Ne 15:25	I exhorted my brothers to listen to the word of God.  I pleaded to them will all the energies of my soul.  I tried to persuade them will all the faculties I possessed.  I wanted them to listen to God's word.  I wanted them to keep God's commandments always and in all things.
1Ne 15:26	And my brothers asked another question: \Brothers{``What does the river^ of water mean?''}
1Ne 15:27	And I answered: \Nephi{``The water is a representation of the filthiness^ of the mind.  A man's mind gets so overwhelmed with other things, he does not recognize how filthy the water is.''}
1Ne 15:28	And I explained the awful gulf^ that separated the wicked from the tree of life.  That separated the wicked from the saints of God.
1Ne 15:29	I explained that the gulf represented the awful hell.  I explained what the angel taught me about this hell.  It was prepared for the wicked.  It was a great pit.
1Ne 15:30	I also explained that our father saw the justice of God.  Like a flaming^ [sword] it will divide the wicked from the righteous.  Justice is like an eternal flaming fire.  Forever, it ascends to God and has no end.
1Ne 15:31	And my brothers asked another question: \Brothers{``What exactly is this torment?  Is it a temporal torment, while one is in a physical body?  Or is it the final state of the soul after the death of the physical body?''}
1Ne 15:32	And I explained that this torment described the relationship between both the temporal and the spiritual.  A person has days of probation to live according to his choices.  After this life, this person will be judged by the works performed in the temporal body.  The judgment may be a torment of the soul because of the things done with the temporal body.
1Ne 15:33	The person will be brought to stand before God and be judged according to actions and decisions made. If one dies in wickedness rejecting spiritual and righteous things, this person will be cast off.  If one's deeds have been filthy, the person must be filthy.  Filthy things cannot dwell in the kingdom of God.  If it were^ so, the kingdom of God would also be filthy.   
1Ne 15:34	But the kingdom of God is not filthy.  No unclean thing can enter into the kingdom of God.  Therefore, there must be another place prepared for the filthy.  A place of filthiness.
1Ne 15:35	There is a place prepared for the filthy.  It was prepared by the {\wicked{wicked one}}^.  It is the awful hell.  The great pit of despair.  A man's soul has one of two final states.  He can live in the kingdom of God if clean.  Or he will be cast out into hell if unclean.  This judgment is because of God's justice.
1Ne 15:36	The wicked are separated from the righteous.  The wicked are separated from the tree of life.  They cannot eat of the fruit of the tree.  The fruit which is most precious and desirable.  The fruit^ that is the greatest of God's gifts.  This is what I explained to my brothers.  Amen.
1Ne 16:1	After I (Nephi) explained these things to my brothers, they responded: \Brothers{``You have declared hard things. Your words burden^ us.  This burden is too much.''} 
1Ne 16:2	And I agreed with them: \Nephi{``I know I have spoken hard things.  The righteous are justified by the truth.  The righteous will be lifted up at the judgment day.  The wicked find the truth to be hard.  The wicked are guilty.  The truth is hard.  It cuts them^ to the very center of their being.''}
1Ne 16:3	\Nephi{``If you were righteous.  If you did listen to the truth.  If you obeyed the truth.  You would walk in righteousness before God.  You would not murmur and complain that these truths are hard things.''}
1Ne 16:4	And I did constantly and faithfully exhort my brothers.  I exhorted them to keep God's commandments.
1Ne 16:5	For a time, my brothers humbled themselves before God.  I had joy and great hopes^ for them.  I hoped they would walk in the paths of righteousness.
1Ne 16:6	All of these things transpired while my father dwelt in a tent in the valley he named Lemuel.
1Ne 16:7	And I married^ one of the (five) daughters of Ishmael.  And my brothers also married other daughters of Ishmael.  And Zoram (Laban's servant) married the oldest of the daughters of Ishmael.
1Ne 16:8	Lehi had fulfilled the tasks God had required.  He left Jerusalem.  He got the record of his people.  And he got wives for his sons.  God blessed me (Nephi) exceedingly^ because I helped my father fulfill these tasks.
1Ne 16:9	One night, God spoke to Lehi.  He told Lehi to continue his journey the very next morning.
1Ne 16:10	The next morning, my father arose.  He went to the door of his tent.  There he discovered a round ball^  on the ground.  It astonished him.  It had curious workmanship.  It was made of fine^ brass.  The ball had two spindles inside.  One spindle pointed the way we should go into the wilderness.  I will call it the \emph{Liahona}.
1Ne 16:11	We gathered^ up our things.  At least everything we could carry.  We had seeds of every kind.  We also had the remainder of the provisions God had given us.
1Ne 16:12	We did take our tents and depart into the wilderness.  We crossed^ the river Laman.  
1Ne 16:13	And we traveled for four^ days.    We traveled in a south-southeast^ direction.  We again pitched our tents.  We called this place Shazer (which means twisting). 
1Ne 16:14	We took our bows and arrows to kill wild animals as food for our families.  We returned to our families at Shazer after a successful hunt.  After a time, we again broke camp and continued our journey in the same direction.  We were trying to keep to the more fertile parts of the wilderness.  We were still in the region near the Red Sea.
1Ne 16:15	We did travel for many^ days.  We killed food along the way.  We used our bows and arrows.  We used our slings with stones.
1Ne 16:16	We did follow the directions^ of the \emph{Liahona}.  We were led to the most fertile^ parts of the wilderness.  
1Ne 16:17	After traveling again for many days, we pitched^ our tents to rest.  We agin went hunting to obtain food for our families. 
1Ne 16:18	I (Nephi) went out to hunt with the other men.  During the outing, I broke^ my bow which was made of fine steel.  It was the best bow our family had.  The others got angry with me because I broke my bow.  We did not have a successful hunt.
1Ne 16:19	We returned to our families without food.  Everyone was hungry.  Everyone was weary from travel.
1Ne 16:20	And the murmuring commenced.  Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael complained exceedingly.  They complained about the suffering and afflictions of the wilderness.  My father joined in.  He murmured against God.  Everyone was upset.  Everyone was complaining. Everyone wanted food.
1Ne 16:21	And the other men complained that their bows had lost their springs.  They grumbled that it was too difficult to hunt with their bows.  They did torment^ me with their complaining.  
1Ne 16:22	I called the others out for complaining.  I let them know that they were complaining against God.  They were hardening their hearts again.
1Ne 16:23	Instead of complaining, I made^ a bow out of wood.  I also took a straight stick and made an arrow.  I armed myself with this bow and arrow.  I also armed myself with a sling and stones.  And I asked^ my father: \Nephi{``Where should I go to obtain food?''}
1Ne 16:24	And my father asked God in prayer where I should go.  He and the rest of the family humbled themselves before God after hearing my rebuke.  I had said many things to them with the energy^ of my soul. 
1Ne 16:25	And God answered my father.  God chastened Lehi for murmuring.  Lehi was genuinely sorry for having complained.
1Ne 16:26	And God instructed my father to examine the \emph{Liahona}: \God{``Look at the \emph{Liahona}.  Behold what is written there.''}
1Ne 16:27	And my father looked.  And he saw the things that were written^ on the \emph{Liahona}.  And he did fear and tremble exceedingly.  And so did my brothers, the sons of Ishmael, and our wives.
1Ne 16:28	I observed^ that the pointers only worked when we were faithful to God.  When we were diligent and righteous.  When we did not complain.
1Ne 16:29	I also observed that there was new writing on the \emph{Liahona}.  It was plain to read.  It contained a message from God.  What was written would change from time to time.  According to our faith and diligence.  (And thus we see that by small means God can bring about great things.)
1Ne 16:30	I follow the written directions written on the \emph{Liahona}^.  I went^ to the top of the mountain.
1Ne 16:31	And I had a successful hunt.  I killed wild animals.  I obtained^ food for our families.
1Ne 16:32	And I returned to my family and our tents.  I carried^ the animals I had killed.  Everyone was overjoyed!  And they humbled themselves before God.  They gave thanks^ to God.
1Ne 16:33	After resting for a time, we continued our journey.  We traveled in the same general south-southeast direction.  After traveling for many days, we again pitched our tents.  We rested^ for some time. 
1Ne 16:34	Next^, Ishmael died.  We buried him in a place^ called Nahom.
1Ne 16:35	The daughters of Ishmael mourned^ exceedingly.  They mourned the loss of their father.  They mourned because of the great afflictions they were experiencing in the wilderness.  They began to murmur against my father.  They complained that Lehi brought them out of Jerusalem: \Daughters{``Our father is dead!  We have wandered in the wilderness.  We have suffered much affliction, hunger, thirst, and fatigue.  Certainly, we will die of hunger^ in the wilderness.''}
1Ne 16:36	In this manner, they murmured against my father.  They also murmured against me.  They wanted^ to return to Jerusalem.
1Ne 16:37	Laman said to Lemuel (and the sons of Ishmael were listening): \Laman{``Let's kill our father!  Let's also kill our brother Nephi!  Our brother Nephi has taken it upon himself to be our ruler and teacher, even though we are his older brothers.''}
1Ne 16:38	\Laman{``And Nephi claims that God has talked to him.  And that he has seen angels.  He tells us these things.  He lies to us.  He wants to deceive our eyes and our thinking.  With his cunning, he wants to lead us away to some strange wilderness.  When we get there, he will try and make himself king^ and ruler over us.  He has these selfish desires.''}  This is how Laman used words to stir up anger in the hearts of Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael.
1Ne 16:39	But God intervened.  God's voice came^ and spoke to them.  God chastened them exceedingly.  They turned their anger away.   They did repent of their sins. And then God did again bless us with food, that we did not die. 
1Ne 17:1	 We again continued^ our journey in the wilderness.  At this point, we began to travel nearly^ directly east.  Our journey was very difficult.  We did wade^ through affliction in the wilderness.  And our women gave birth to children during the journey.
1Ne 17:2	 During this^ time we lived on raw^ meat.  Even so, our women were able to nourish their newborn children.  God indeed blessed us greatly^.  In fact, our women became strong as they became accustom to our journey.  They stopped murmuring.
1Ne 17:3	 In this, we see that God's commandments are fulfilled.  If the children of men keeps God's commandments, God will nourish them.  God will strengthen them.  God will provide a way and means whereby they can accomplish the things He commands.  In this manner, God did provide for us as we wandered^ in this wilderness.
1Ne 17:4	 We did sojourn^ for many years.  In total, we journeyed^ for eight years in the wild.
1Ne 17:5	 We arrived at a land which we named Bountiful.  We named the place Bountiful because it was bountiful with fruit and wild honey.  God prepared this place for us.  We saw a great sea.  We called^  this sea Irreantum which means \emph{many waters}.
1Ne 17:6	 We pitched our tents by the seashore.  We had suffered tremendously on our journey.  So much suffering that we cannot write it all down.  Even so, we rejoiced exceedingly when we arrived at this seashore.  We called the place Bountiful because it had so much fruit.
1Ne 17:7	 I rested^ in the land of Bountiful for many days.  God's voice^ called to me: \God{``Arise! Go to that mountain!''}  And I arose.  I ascended to the mountain. And I cried^ to God.
1Ne 17:8	 In the mountain, God instructed me: \God{``You need to build a ship.  Let me show you how to build the ship.  [Nephi is shown.] With this ship, I will carry your people across these [many] waters.''}
1Ne 17:9	 And I replied: \Nephi{``God, I need tools to build the ship as You showed me.  Where should I go to find the ore?  I will need to craft tools with molten^ ore.''} 
1Ne 17:10	 And God told me where would find ore.  With this ore, I could make tools.
1Ne 17:11	 I [prepared a process to melt ore].  I made^  bellows from animal hides.  After I had prepared [my furnace], I made fire.  I struck two stones together to make fire.
1Ne 17:12	 As we journeyed in the wilderness, we had not used^ fire.  God had not allowed us to use fire.  God explained: \God{``I will make your food sweet so you don't have to cook it.''}
1Ne 17:13	 God had also promised: \God{``I will be your light^  in the wilderness.  I will prepare the path before you.  I will do so if you keep my commandments.  If you keep my commandments, I will lead you toward that promised land.  And you will know that you are led and preserved because of Me.''}
1Ne 17:14	 God had also said: \God{``After you arrive in the promised land, you will know that I am Lord God.  That I did deliver you from destruction.  That I did bring you out of the land of Jerusalem.''}
1Ne 17:15	 I strived to be faithful and diligent in keeping God's commandments.  I also exhorted my brothers to do the same.  
1Ne 17:16	 And I did make tools from the ore.  I extracted this melted ore from the^ rock. 
1Ne 17:17	 And when my brothers^ figured out what I was doing, the murmuring commenced: \Brothers{``Our brother is a fool.  He thinks he can build a ship.  He thinks he can cross these \emph{many waters}.''}
1Ne 17:18	 My brothers complained because they did not want to help.  It was hard work.  They thought it was a waste of time and effort.  They didn't believe I was capable of building a ship.  They didn't believe God gave me instructions on how to build the ship.
1Ne 17:19	 I got sad to see my brothers harden their hearts.  Seeing me sad encouraged them.  It made them happy that I was discouraged.  They^ rejoiced: \Brothers{``We knew you couldn't build a ship.  You're not smart^ enough.  We knew you weren't capable of building such a great task.''}
1Ne 17:20	 \Brothers{``You're crazy! Your heart is full of foolish imaginations! You're just like our father.  He has led us out of the land of Jerusalem.  We have wandered in the desert for eight years!  Our women have suffered and toiled even when pregnant.  They have born us children and suffered greatly.  They almost died.  And maybe it would have been better if they had just died in Jerusalem.  Dying maybe was better than suffering this much.''}
1Ne 17:21	 \Brothers{``For eight years we have suffered in the wilderness.  We could have spent that time in Jerusalem.  In the land of our inheritance.  With all of our riches: gold, silver, and precious things.  We would have been happy!''}
1Ne 17:22	 \Brothers{``We know the people in Jerusalem were righteous.  They kept God's commandments, all of them.  They obeyed the law of Moses.  We know they were righteous.  But our father^ judged them.  Our father led us away from Jerusalem because we listened^ to him. Because we listened to you!''}  In this manner did my brothers complain and murmur against me and my father.
1Ne 17:23	 And I responded^: \Nephi{``Our fathers were children of Israel.  The children of Israel were delivered from their Egyptian captivity.  They were led out of Egypt into the wilderness.  Do you think this would have happened if they hadn't listened to God?''}
1Ne 17:24	 \Nephi{``Do you really believe this would have happened if God hadn't commanded it?  God commanded Moses to lead them out of bondage!''}
1Ne 17:25	 \Nephi{``We know the children of Israel were in bondage.  Hard labor was the nature of their bondage.  You know that being delivered from bondage was a good thing for them.''}
1Ne 17:26	 \Nephi{``You also know God commanded Moses to delivery them out of bondage.  You know that by God's word the waters of the Red Sea were divided.  You know the children of Israel crossed on dry ground.''}
1Ne 17:27	 \Nephi{``You know the Egyptians drown in the Red Sea.  The armies of Pharaoh drown.''}
1Ne 17:28	 \Nephi{``You know the children of Israel were fed manna in the wilderness.''}
1Ne 17:29	 \Nephi{``You know that Moses called upon God.  With God's word and power, Moses smote a rock.  From this rock flowed water.  And the children of Israel quenched their thirst.''}
1Ne 17:30	 \Nephi{``God had led them.  God gave them shade by day.  God gave them light by night.  God gave them what they needed to survive in the wilderness.  Yet they hardened their hearts.  They blinded their minds.  They complained to Moses.  They murmured against God.''}
1Ne 17:31	 \Nephi{``God's word is powerful.  By His word, He can destroy^ them.  By His word, He can lead them.  By His word, He can do all things for them.  And everything that was done, was done by His word.''}
1Ne 17:32	 \Nephi{``After the children of Israel crossed the river Jordan, God made them mighty^.  He gave them the power to drive out the children of the land.  He gave the children of Israel the power to scatter and destroy the children of the land.''}
1Ne 17:33	 \Nephi{``And what of these children of the land?  Why were they driven out of the land of promise and destroyed?  Do you suppose they were righteous? I tell you, No!''}
1Ne 17:34	 \Nephi{``If the children of the land had been righteous, would God have made our fathers \emph{more choice}? I tell you, No!''}
1Ne 17:35	 \Nephi{``God values all flesh equally.  Yet God favors^ the righteous.  For this reason did he curse the land for one nation and blessed it for another nation.  The children of the land had rejected God.  They rejected God's word.  They were full of unrighteousness.  God's wrath came upon them.  God cursed the land against them.  And God blessed the land for our fathers, the children of Israel.  God's curse led to their destruction.  God's blessing led our fathers to have the power to obtain the land.''}
1Ne 17:36	 \Nephi{``You see, God created the earth.  God created the earth that it should be inhabited with life. God created His children that they may possess this inhabitated earth.''}
1Ne 17:37	 \Nephi{``God establishes a righteous nation.  God destroys a unrighteous nation.''} 
1Ne 17:38	 \Nephi{``God leads the righteous nation to precious lands.  God curses the land against the unrighteous nation.  God exterminates^ the unrighteous nation that lives in precious lands.''}
1Ne 17:39	 \Nephi{``God rules in the high heavens.  The high heavens are God's throne.  This earth is God's footstool.''}
1Ne 17:40	 \Nephi{``God loves those that accept Him as their God.  He loved our fathers.  He covenanted with them.  God covenanted with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  God remembers His promises.  Because of His covenant with Jacob, God delivered his children out of the land of Egypt.  Out of bondage.''}
1Ne 17:41	 \Nephi{``Even as God delivered the children of Israel, they hardened their hearts.  Just like you have.  So God subjected them to difficulties.  God sent flying serpents among them.  God wanted them to repent^.  God also prepared a way for the children to be healed if bitten by a serpent.  To be healed, a man only had to look.  The task was so simple.  It was so easy.  Yet many died because they didn't look.''}
1Ne 17:42	 \Nephi{``And this cycle with the children of Israel continued as they traveled in the wilderness.  They would harden their hearts.  They would complain to Moses.  They would murmur against God.  God would subject them to difficulties. They would repent or die.  In this way, God demonstrated His supreme power.  God led them to the land of promise.''}
1Ne 17:43	 \Nephi{``After all this, the children of Israel have again become unrighteous.  They have hardened their hearts.  They have become wicked.  The time is ripe for their destruction.  Today, the children of Israel are about^ to be destroyed.  I know that very soon, they will be destroyed.  Only a few will survive.  They will be led away into captivity.''}
1Ne 17:44	 \Nephi{``God commanded^ my father to depart into the wilderness.   Some of the unrighteous Jews wanted to kill him.  You also have wanted to kill him.  You are murderers in your hearts just like they were!''}
1Ne 17:45	 \Nephi{``You are just like the unrighteous Jews!  You are quick to do unrighteousness.  You are slow to remember God.  You have seen an angel.  An angel spoke you.  God has also spoken to you through His still, small voice.  You no longer hear this voice.  You are behond feeling.  So God had to speak to you with his voice of thunder.  Which caused^ the earth to quake as if it were to break apart.''} 
1Ne 17:46	 \Nephi{``You also know that God is powerful.  By God's word, he can do more than merely have the earth quake.  God can make rough places be smooth.  God can make smooth places to be broken in pieces.  If God wanted, He could completely cause the earth to cease to exist.  God has this supreme power, yet you still harden your hearts?''}
1Ne 17:47	 \Nephi{``Brothers, your callousness breaks my heart.  Your obdurate attitude racks my soul.  Your obstinance is insufferable!  This truth overwhelms me.  God's Spirit overpowers my physical body.  I have no strength!''}
1Ne 17:48	 After speaking this way to my brothers, they became angry.  They wanted to throw^ me into the depths of the sea.  As they approached, I rebuked them: \Nephi{``In the name of Almighty God, I command you to leave me in peace.  I am filled with God's power, an all-consuming power.  If you touch me, God will kill you.  You will wither^ like a dried reed.''}
1Ne 17:49	 I told my brothers to stop complaining.  To stop murmuring against their^ father.  I reminded them that God commanded me to build a ship.  I needed their help.  I needed their physical labor.
1Ne 17:50	 And I continued: \Nephi{``If God commanded me to do everything^ I could do it.  If He commanded me, I could tell the water to be earth (and earth to be water).  If God commanded it, and I say it, it will be done.''}
1Ne 17:51	 \Nephi{``God has great power.  God has performed so many miracles among the children of men.  If He has done these things, why can't He teach me^ how to build a ship?''}   
1Ne 17:52	 I had said so many things to my brothers.  I astonished them into silence.  They stopped arguing with me.  They stopped trying to get their hands on me.  In fact, for several days they wouldn't even touch me with their fingers.  I I had put the fear of God into them.  They feared that if they touched me, they would wither and die like a dried reed. 
1Ne 17:53	 As I recognized this fear, God told me: \God{``Stretch forth your hand and touch them.  I won't have them wither and die.  I will just shake^ them.  This will remind them I am Lord their God.''}
1Ne 17:54	 And I obeyed.  I reached out my hand and touched my brothers.  They did not wither and die.  But they did convulse.
1Ne 17:55	 When they recovered, they spoke: \Brothers{``God has shaken us.  We know God is with you.  He gave you the power to touch and shock us.''}  And they bowed^ down before me.  They were about to worship me, but I stopped them saying: \Nephi{``Worship God.  Honor^ your father and mother that you will have a long life in the promised land God will give you.  I am just your brother.  In fact, your younger brother.  Don't worship me.''}
1Ne 18:1	 My brothers repented.  They worshipped God.  And they went forth^ with me and helped me with the work.  And we did work the timbers in a novel way. From time to time, God would show details about how I should work the timbers of the ship.
1Ne 18:2	 I did not work the timbers after the manner of men.  I worked the timbers as God showed me.  I did not build the ship after the manner^ of men.  I built the ship as God showed me.
1Ne 18:3	 I ascended to the mountain often.  There, I would pray often to God.  God would show me great things.
1Ne 18:4	 After the ship was finished, my brothers saw that it was good.  They observed that the ship^  was of a superior quality.  As a result, they humbled themselves before God.  The knew this unique design came from God.
1Ne 18:5	 God spoke to my father.  God commanded that we should pack up and enter the ship.
1Ne 18:6	 The next day, we prepared the ship.  We stocked^ the ship with provisions: fruit, meat, honey, [and fresh water].  We stocked it with seeds.  The remaining space was stocked with personal possessions prioritized by one's age.  Then we boarded the ship, with our wives and children.
1Ne 18:7	 My father had^ two additional sons while we journeyed in the wilderness.  Jacob was the name of the older son.  Joseph was the name of the younger son.
1Ne 18:8	 We had finished preparing for our trip.  We boarded the ship.  We set sail^.  The winds drove our ship towards the promised land.
1Ne 18:9	 We traveled for many days on the sea.  The winds drove our ship.  Half of the party (my brothers, the sons of Ishmael, and their wives) began^ to frolic.  They began to dance.  They began to sing.  They began to speak^ rudely to the other half of the party.  They forgot how they had got to this point.  Their boisterous behavior was exceedingly course and inappropriate.  
1Ne 18:10	 I spoke to them with soberness^.  I was afraid God would become angry with us.  God may see this behavior and destroy us.  God may have the sea swallow our ship into the depths.  They did not want to hear my rebuke.  They got angry, saying: \Brothers{``Our younger brother will not tell us what to do.  He is not the ruler over us.''}
1Ne 18:11	 Laman and Lemuel did take hold of me.  They did bind^ me with cords.  They treated me harshly.  God allowed me to suffer for a time.  God wanted to show His power.  God wanted to teach them a lesson.
1Ne 18:12	 My brothers had bound me with cords.  I could not move.  The \emph{Liahona} stopped working.
1Ne 18:13	 My brothers did not know which direction to steer^ the ship.  Then a great storm arose.  Violent winds drove the ship back in the direction from which we came.  For three days^  the storm raged.  Finally, my brothers became frightened.  They were afraid they would drown in the sea.  Yet they would not free me from my bonds.
1Ne 18:14	 On the fourth day, the raging tempest got worse.
1Ne 18:15	 The sea was about to swallow our ship into the depths. After four stormy days, my brothers finally realized God was in charge.  God was going to kill them if they did not repent of their unrighteousness.  God's judgment was upon them. Wherefore, they came to me and released me from my bonds.  My wrists and my ankles were swollen.  They were very sore from being tightly bound by cords for four days. 
1Ne 18:16	 Even so, I did not murmur against God because of my suffering.  In fact, I raised my head to heaven and praised God all day long.
1Ne 18:17	 My father, Lehi, had spoken to Laman, Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael.  He implored them to stop.  They would not listen.  They threatened everyone that tried to speak on my behalf.  My parents were advanced in age.  They had already^ suffered so much grief because of their children.  This latest event drove them to their sick-beds.
1Ne 18:18	 My parents were on the brink of death.  They were filled^  with grief and sorrow.  My brothers unrighteousness didn't help.  They were about to be cast overboard^ into watery graves.
1Ne 18:19	 Nothing would soften the hearts of my brothers.  Not my wife's tears and prayers.  Not my children's tears and prayers.  Not my mother's anguish.  Not even the grief^  of my youngest brothers (Jacob and Joseph). 
1Ne 18:20	 But eventually the hearts of my brothers were softened.  Softened by the power of God.  My brothers knew^ that personal destruction was imminently upon them.  The sea was about to swallow our ship into the depths.  They knew only God could save them.  So they repented, and released me from my bonds.
1Ne 18:21	 After I was released, I took the \emph{Liahona} from them.  And the \emph{Liahona} directed me according to my desires.  And I prayed to God.  After I prayed, the winds stopped.  The storm subsided.  The seas calmed.
1Ne 18:22	 I again guided the ship.  And we again sailed towards the promised land.
1Ne 18:23	 And after many days, we arrived^  at the promised land^.  We disembarked from the ship.  We pitched our tents.  And we called the place^ the promised land. 	
1Ne 18:24	 And we did till the earth.  We planted all^ of the seeds we had brought with us.  And the crops grew.  The yield was abundant.  God blessed us.
1Ne 18:25	 And we did find many^ beasts on the land.  We encountered: cows, oxen, horses, donkeys^, goats and wild^ goats, and many other wild animals that would benefit man.  There were many beasts in the forests.    And we did find many types^ of ore: gold, silver, and copper.
1Ne 19:1	 And God commanded me to make plates of metal from the ore we found.  And I did make^ plates. On these plates, I engraved the record^ of my father.  I engraved the record of our journeys in the wilderness.  I engraved the prophecies of my father.  And I engraved many of my own prophecies.
1Ne 19:2	 At the time, I did not understand why God commanded me to make these^ large plates.  Again, these larger plates contained: the record of my father, the genealogy of his forefathers, and most of the proceedings^ of what transpired in our journey in the wilderness.  I include the most important things from the larger plates the smaller plates as well.  
1Ne 19:3	 God commanded that I also make smaller plates.  These plates should emphasize spiritual things: both about the ministry of my people and the prophecies received from God.  These smaller plates contain the more plain and precious truths.  They are kept as a special record of instruction for my people who possess the land after me.  They are also kept for other wise purposes.  Purposes that God knows, but I do not.
1Ne 19:4	 The larger plates^ give greater detail into the account of the political affairs of my people:  wars, contentions, and destructions of my people.  And both sets of plates should be handed down when I am gone.  The larger plates from one leader to another.  The smaller plates from one prophet to another.  This tradition must continue until God commands otherwise.  
1Ne 19:5	 I will explain how I made^ these plates later on.  I proceed writing the precious truths on these smaller plates.  I do so that the sacred things may be kept for the knowledge of my people.
1Ne 19:6	 I only write sacred things on these plates.  If I make a mistake, I apologize.  A mistake I might make could have been from a previous writer of old.  Regardless, I will not justify or defend the mistake.  I will take responsibility and apologize.
1Ne 19:7	 Discerning what is precious is not an easy task.  What some consider to be of great worth to the body and soul, others disregard and trample under their feet.  Yes, some men even trample under feet their very God.  I write trample under their feet; however, I should^ say it differently.    They despise God.  They disregard God's counsel.
1Ne 19:8	 The Messiah will come according to the words of the angel.  He will come six hundred years^ from the time my father left Jerusalem.
1Ne 19:9	 When the Messiah comes, the world will reject Him.  They will reject Him because of their unrighteousness.  They will judge him to be worthless.  They will scourge Him, and He will allow it.  They will smite Him, and He will allow it.  They will spit on Him, and He will allow it.  He allows it because of the love and kindness He possesses for the children of men.
1Ne 19:10	 The God of our fathers will be the Messiah.  The God who led our fathers out of Egypt.  The God who led them out of bondage.  They God that preserved them in the wilderness.  The God of Abraham^.  The God of Isaac.  The God of Jacob.  According to the words of the angel, God will yield himself up as a (mortal) man into the hands of the wicked.  He will be lifted up on a cross according to the words of Zenoch^.  He will be crucified according to the words of Neum.  He will be placed in a sepulchre according^ to the words of Zenos.  Zenos declared that a sign would be given of His death.  A sign given to those who inhabit the isles^ of the sea.  Those that belong to the house of Israel.  The sign is darkness.  For three days^ there will be darkness.  
1Ne 19:11	 Zenos^ described this darkness: \Zenos{``God will most certainly visit the house of Israel at that day.  Some He will visit with His voice because of their righteousness.  They will receive His message with great joy and salvation.  Others He will visit with destruction.  There will be lightning and thunder^.  There will be a fiery tempest.  There will be smoke and a great vapor of darkness.  The earth will open.  Mountains^ will be lifted up. All by the power of God.''}
1Ne 19:12	 \Zenos{``All these things will happen''} said Zenos. \Zenos{``The earth will groan from within.  All the rocks of the earth will split.  This guttural groan and splitting of rocks will astonish many.  Inspired by God's Spirit, kings of the isles of the sea will exclaim:''} \Kings{``The God of nature suffers.''}
1Ne 19:13	 \Zenos{``And those in Jerusalem who crucified God,''} said the prophet, \Zenos{``They will be severely punished by all nations for what they have done.  They have crucified the God of Israel.  They have rejected signs and wonders.  They have turned their hearts from the power and glory of the God of Israel.''} 
1Ne 19:14	 \Zenos{``And because they turned their hearts,''} said the prophet, \Zenos{``They will be hated of all nations.  They have despised the Holy One of Israel.  As a result, they will wander in the flesh, be scattered and destroyed.  Their name \emph{Jews} will be commonly spoken with contempt and disapproval.''}
1Ne 19:15	 \Zenos{``Neverless,''} said the prophet, \Zenos{``One day they will repent.  They will turn their hearts again to the Holy One of Israel.  God will then honor the covenants He has made with their forefathers.''}
1Ne 19:16	 \Zenos{``God will also remember the covenants He made to those on the isles^  of the sea''} said the prophet Zenos.  \Zenos{``He will gather all who are of the house of Israel.  God says: ``I will gather my people from the four quarters of the earth.''}
1Ne 19:17	 \Zenos{`Yes, all the earth^ will see the salvation of God''} said the prophet. \Zenos{``Every nation, kindred, tongue, and people will be blessed when salvation comes.''}
1Ne 19:18	 I (Nephi) write these things^ for my people.  Perhaps, I might persuade them to remember God as their Messiah, Savior, and Redeemer.
1Ne 19:19	 I speak^ to all of the house of Israel.  One day, they will obtain my words.
1Ne 19:20	 God has been merciful to me.  God has shown me spiritual things.  (God had shown spiritual things to the prophets of old as well).  I realize that without God's benevolence, I would have perished like so many have in Jerusalem.  Even now, I expend significant spiritual energy pleading for those who are at Jerusalem.  My pleadings physically weaken me, to a point that I can't stand.
1Ne 19:21	 God surely does^ reveal His truths to the prophets.  To the prophets of old, God showed them of the impending destruction of the kingdom of Judah.  To the prophets of old, God showed them of our deliverance from this destruction.  Evidence of these prophecies are written on the brass plates.  
1Ne 19:22	 I did teach^ my brothers many things.  I read to them the words of Zenos.  I read to them many other teachings and prophecies engraven on the brass plates.  I shared these things with my brothers that they may understand God's prophecies, even His prophecies of old.
1Ne 19:23	 I also read many of the things written in the books of Moses.  I read these things to them to persuade them to believe in the God of Israel.  The God who will become their Messiah and Redeemer.  I also read to them from the words written of the prophet Isaiah.  And as I read from these great books, I would apply the words to the context of our day.  That is, I did liken all these scriptures to my people in our day.  I did so, that we could profit and learn from these teachings.
1Ne 19:24	 And I told my brothers: \Nephi{``Listen to the words of Isaiah.  He speaks to you, a remnant of the house of Israel.  A remnant the broke off from the house of Israel.  Listen to the words of Isaiah.  He wrote these things for the house of Israel.  Listen to his words, and liken them unto yourselves.  That you may have hope for yourselves.  And that you may express hope for those in Israel.  That one day, they will remember their God.''}  In this manner Isaiah^ writes:
1Ne 20:1	 \Isaiah{``Listen to me and hear this, O house^ of Jacob.  You are called the house of Israel.  You have come forth out of the waters of Judah.  You have come out of the waters^ of baptism.  You swear an oath in God's name to worship God.  Yet, your are not truthful nor righteous in fulfilling this oath.''}
1Ne 20:2	 \Isaiah{``You say you are from the holy city.  Yet you do not abide with God.  Yes, the God of Israel who is the Lord of Hosts^:''}
1Ne 20:3	 \God{``I announced these important things from the beginning.  In the moment I proclaimed them, I acted without hesitation.  And they came to pass.''}
1Ne 20:4	 \God{``And I did this because I knew you are obstinate.  Your stubborn neck is like iron sinew you and will not turn to Me.  Your brow is like brass, and you will not look up to Me.''}
1Ne 20:5	 \God{``And from the beginning, I have made clear My will.  Before things happened, I would tell you they would happen.  And I would tell you before, so after you could not give credit to your false gods: your idol, your graven image, your molten image.''}
1Ne 20:6	 \God{``You have seen and heard Me do this.  Will you not affirm them to be true?  And I have shown you new things.  And I have shown you hidden things.  I have shown you things you did not know.''}
1Ne 20:7	 \God{``Things that were not from the beginning.  Things that were created now. I proclaimed them to you before^ anyone had heard of them.  I did this so you could not claim you already knew them.''}
1Ne 20:8	 \God{``You had not heard them.  You had not known them.  Your spiritual ears^ have been closed since the beginning.  And I knew this would happen.  I knew you would be unfaithful, deceitful, and dishonest.  Before the womb^ I knew^ you [Judah's seed] as rebels^.''}
1Ne 20:9	 \God{``Even so, I defer my anger. I will not cut you off. I will be patient from action. I do this to uphold my name. My name is my word.  My word is my bond.  It is honorable and of the highest^ rank.''}
1Ne 20:10	 \God{``I have refined you in your adversity.  I have chose you in the furnace of affliction.''}
1Ne 20:11	 \God{``I do these things for My own purpose.  I will not allow My name to be polluted.  I will not give My glory^ and rank to another.''}
1Ne 20:12	 \God{``Listen^ to me O Jacob.  Listen to me O Israel.  I am He. (I am Jehovah).  I am the first.  I am also the last.''}
1Ne 20:13	 \God{``With Mine hand, I laid the foundation of the earth.  With My right hand, I measure the heavens^.  When I call^ the host of heavens, they immediately answer Me by standing up together.''}
1Ne 20:14	 \Isaiah{``Gather yourselves and listen^ to me.  I am God's servant.  Who among the heavens declared these truths to the heavens?  The Eternal Father.  The Eternal Father loved and selected Jehovah.  Jehovah will fulfill the Eternal Father's word.  Every word declared will be fulfilled^ by the heavens.  Jehovah will do as He pleases with Babylon.  Jehovah's power and might will fall upon^  the Chaldeans.''}
1Ne 20:15	 \Isaiah{``As the Eternal Father^ has declared:''}  \Father{``I am the Father.  I have spoken.  I have summoned^ Him.  I have appointed Jehovah to be My vizier. He will fulfill My will.''}
1Ne 20:16	 \Isaiah{``And Jehovah declares:''}  \God{``Come near to me.  I have not spoken in secret.  I have spoken from the beginning.  I have spoken since the time I was appointed.  The Eternal Father (and His Spirit) has sent Me.''} 
1Ne 20:17	 \Isaiah{``The Eternal Father^ declares:''} \Father{``I have sent Jehovah.  Jehovah is the Holy One of Israel.  He is your Redeemer.  He will teach you to improve yourselves.  He will show you the path you should go because He has taken that path Himself.''}
1Ne 20:18	 \Isaiah{``And Jehovah declares:''} \God{``I wish you had listened^ to My commandments.  If you had, your peace would flow as a river.  Your righteousness would be constant as the waves of the sea.''}
1Ne 20:19	 \God{``If you had, your seed^ would have been as numerous as the sands of the sea.  If you had, the offspring of your bowels would have been as numerous as the gravel of the river.  If you had, you would have avoided being destroyed.  You would have avoided being cut off from the promises made to Jacob.''} 
1Ne 20:20	 \God{``But a remnant will I redeem to fulfill promises made to my servant Jacob.  This remnant will be guided to escape the might of Babylon.  This remnant will flee from the Chaldeans before Jerusalem is destroyed.''} \Isaiah{``This remnant will sing praises to God for being delivered which will spread to the ends of the earth:''} \Zion{``God has redeemed His servant Jacob!''}
1Ne 20:21	 \Isaiah{``As they traveled, the remnant^ did not thirst.  God led them through the deserts.  God caused water to flow out of the rock for them.  God also cleaved^ the rock.  Waters gushed out.''} 
1Ne 20:22	 \Isaiah{``God had done all this.  God had even done greater^ things.  Even so, some continue in unrighteousness. As God says:''} \God{``Those who deviate from My law will not have peace of mind.''}
1Ne 21:1	 And again, the words of Isaiah: \Isaiah{``Listen to me, remnant of the house^ of Israel.  You are on isles far from me.  You have been broken off from the house of Israel.  You have been driven out of Jerusalem because of the wickedness of the Jewish leaders.  You have been scattered abroad yet you are my people, remnant of the house of Israel. Yet listen to me and hear this. God has called me from the womb.  From the womb of my mother God announced my name.''}
1Ne 21:2	 \Isaiah{``And God has made my tongue like a sharp sword.  In the shelter of God's hand I am concealed and protected.  God has polished my messaging and delivery.  Like an arrow I am. And God has a quiverful^ of arrows. In His quiver I am concealed and protected.''} 
1Ne 21:3	 \Isaiah{``And God told me:''} \God{``You are my servant, son of Israel.  In you, I will be glorified.''}
1Ne 21:4	 \Isaiah{``And I responded to God:''} \Isaiah{``(How will You be glorified?) I have failed you.  I have labored in vain.  My efforts have been worthless.  Yet, I tried.  I will respect Your judgment. You will determine my reward.''}
1Ne 21:5	 \Isaiah{``And God answered me.  The God that formed me from the womb to be His servant.  The God who tasked me with bringing Jacob's house back to Him.  He said:''}  \God{``Yes, you tried.  Although Israel has not returned to Me, you will be glorified for your work.  You are mine^ because you have labored for Me.''}
1Ne 21:6	 \God{``You have been a light^ for the world.  You have roused the tribes of Jacob to repent.  You have brought the remnant of the House of Israel to a restored knowledge of their purpose.  You will also be a light for the world for the Gentiles.  Through you, the ends of the earth will know that salvation is only possible through Me.''}
1Ne 21:7	 \Isaiah{``And God continued to instruct me.  The God who is the Redeemer of Israel.  The God who is the Holy One.  Me whom man will despise.  Me whom nations will abhore. Me whom will be a servant to rulers.  God said:''} \God{``Kings will turn to Me and increase in power.  Their sons (princes) will worship Me.  All because you have been faithful advising them for Me.''}
1Ne 21:8	 \Isaiah{``And God said:''} \God{``In due time, I will hear you, O isles of the sea.  In a day of salvation, I will help you.  I will preserve you that you may reclaim your deserted inheritances. I will give you another servant to teach you about Me.  I will make the earth firm^ for you.  I will ratify the covenant I have made to My People.''}
1Ne 21:9	 \God{``You will have peace and prosperity because of My Power.  You can free prisoners, they will do you no harm.  You can enlighten the ignorant that abide in the darkness.  Those freed from physical and mental prisons will be nourished^ on the highways.  These greener pastures^ will reside in exalted places.''}
1Ne 21:10	 \Isaiah{``They will not hunger or thirst.  The heat of the day or the sun will not bother them.  For the God that has mercy on them will lead them.  He will guide them along springs of water.''}
1Ne 21:11	 \Isaiah{``God has declared:''} \God{``And I will make all My mountains^ passable.  My highways will be exalted.''} 
1Ne 21:12	 \God{``And I will then gather my people together O house of Israel!  Some will come from far.  Some will come from the north.  Some will come from the west.  And some will come from the land of Syene^.''}
1Ne 21:13	 \God{``Sing, O heavens!  Be joyful, O earth!  Break out in song, O mountains!  God will have mercy on His people.  They have been afflicted, but no more.  They have been killed, but no more.  They have been scattered, but no more.  A state^ of my people will be established!''}
1Ne 21:14	 \Isaiah{``Zion^  had said:''} \Zion{``God has abandoned us.  God has forgotten us.''} \Isaiah{``God will show you^ that He has not abandoned you.  He has not forgotten you.''}
1Ne 21:15	 \Isaiah{``How can a woman forget the child on her breast?   How could she not have compassion for the son of her womb?  As God has said:''} \God{``You may have forgotten Me, O House of Israel.  But I will not forget You!''}
1Ne 21:16	 \God{``Behold I have inscribed you on the palms^ of my hands.  The walls^ of your city are continually before me.''}
1Ne 21:17	 \God{``The builders outpace the destroyers.  Therefore, your children will dispatch your ancient enemies.  Those enemies that destroyed and scattered you, your children will drive them from your land.''} 
1Ne 21:18	 \God{``Lift up your eyes and see!  Look around!  Do you see all of these children gathered together?  They will return to your city.  And as I live^, the city will be clothed and adorned with your children.  The city will be beautiful again.  Your children will be clothed with glory, prepared to receive the bridegroom^.  And as a bride holds^ her husband, so also will your children hold Me.''}
1Ne 21:19	 \Isaiah{``Your enemies will be far away.  And your children will gather together in this land previously destroyed by your enemies.  So many will gather.  The areas of your land that once was deserted and desolate will be filled.  And be overflowing!''}
1Ne 21:20	 \Isaiah{``In that day, even after the first^ have been destroyed, your children will be be exceedingly numerous.  So numerous that your children will say:''} \Children{``There isn't enough room^ for us all.  Make room for us all!''}
1Ne 21:21	 \Isaiah{``When you see this, you will say:''} \Zion{``I have lost my children.  I have been deserted.  I have been a captive, moving to and fro.  I was left alone.  I was barren.  Who, then has begotten these children for me?  Who has raised them?  Where have they been?''}
1Ne 21:22	 \Isaiah{``Your children came^ from the Gentiles:''}  \God{``I invited the Gentiles to come to Me.  I explained My ways and invited the Gentiles to embrace My Gospel.  And the Gentiles came and joined^ Me.  They brought their sons in their arms.  Their sons are now your sons.  They carried their daughters upon their shoulders.  Their daughters are now your daughters.''}
1Ne 21:23	 \God{``Look! Kings will maintain and educate the children.  And the wives of the kings, their queens, will nurture, feed, and tend the children.  These Gentile rulers will be brought low.  They will bow down before you and venerate you.  And when this happens, you will know that I am God.  Because you waited for Me, you will not have shame.''}
1Ne 21:24	 \God{``Before, you were prey to mighty enemies. Now, I have delivered the righteous from their captivity!''}
1Ne 21:25	 \God{``Yes the captive will be freed from the mighty enemies. Yes the prey will be delivered from the terrible enemies.  For I, your God, will contend^ with those that contend with you.   I will save your children.''}
1Ne 21:26	 \God{``And I will feed those enemies^ that oppressed you with their own flesh.  They will drink their own blood as if it were sweet wine.  And all flesh will know that I am God.  I am the Lord of Hosts.  I am the Savior.  I am the Redeemer of Israel.  I am the Mighty One of Jacob.''}
1Ne 22:1	 I (Nephi) finished reading these things engraven on the brass plates.  After, my brothers approached me and asked: \Brothers{``What does all of this mean?  Are we to understand these things to be spiritual?  That is, they will come to pass in the spirit but not in the flesh?''}
1Ne 22:2	 And I answered them: \Nephi{``You see these things were made know to the prophet Isaiah^ by the voice of the Spirit.  By the Spirit are all things made known to the prophets.  All things which will come to pass among the children of men while they are in the flesh.''}
1Ne 22:3	 \Nephi{``This means the things I read pertain to both the temporal and the spiritual.  It seems^ the house of Israel (sooner or later) will be scattered across the face of the earth.  The house of Israel will be integrated into all nations.''}
1Ne 22:4	 \Nephi{``Many of the house of Israel have been scattered.  Where they are is unknown to those living in Jerusalem.  The greater part of the tribes of Israel (the Lost Ten Tribes) have been led^ away.  They are scattered to and from.  They are upon the isles of the sea.  Where they are we don't know.  We just know that they have been led away.''} 
1Ne 22:5	 \Nephi{``God will confound^ those led away.  They harden their hearts against God^.  Because of this, they will be scattered among all nations.  They will be hated of all men.  This refers to those scattered already.  And this refers to those who will be scattered^ later.''}   
1Ne 22:6	 \Nephi{``Remember that after they are confounded, they will be nourished.  They will be nourished by the^ Gentiles.  God has raised His hand to support the Gentiles.  He has set the Gentiles as a standard. Their^ children are carried in their arms.  Their daughters are carried upon their shoulders.  Brothers, these things are temporal.  They will happen in the flesh.  They are the result of God's convenants with our forefathers.  The remnant refers to our future posterity.  The remnant also refers to others who are of the house of Israel and scattered.''}
1Ne 22:7	 \Nephi{``The house of Israel will be scattered and confounded.  After this, God will raise up a mighty nation^ among the Gentiles.  This nation will be reside in this promised land.  They will be those that scatter our seed in this land.''}
1Ne 22:8	 \Nephi{``After God uses the mighty nation to scatter our seed, God will do a marvelous work among the Gentiles.  This work will be of great worth to our seed.  It is like our seed is nourished^  by the Gentiles.  It is like our seed will be carried in their^ arms and upon their shoulders.''}
1Ne 22:9	 \Nephi{``And this marvelous work will also be of worth^ for the Gentiles. It will also be of worth to all the house of Israel.  The work will make known the covenants between God and Abraham.  God blessed Abraham saying:''} \God{``In your seed will all^ the families of the earth be blessed.''}
1Ne 22:10	 \Nephi{``And let me explain this to you brothers.  God will stretch out His hand to show His power.  His arm^ will be made bare for all the world to see.  All nations will see God's works through Abraham's seed.  This is how Abraham's seed will bless all families of the earth.''}
1Ne 22:11	 \Nephi{``Yes, God will make bare his arm for all the nations to see.  His marvelous work will be a fulfillment of His covenants made with the house of Israel.  His marvelous work is His gospel.''}
1Ne 22:12	 \Nephi{``God will free the house of Israel from captivity.  They will be restored to the lands of their inheritance.  They will be brought^ out of obscurity and darkness.  They will be brought into the light of truth and knowledge.  They will know their God.  The Mighty One of Israel.  The Lord God.  The Messiah.  Their Redeemer.''}
1Ne 22:13	 \Nephi{``And the enemies of the house of Israel will devour themselves.  They will war among themselves.  The sword of their own hands will fall upon their own heads.  They will be drunken with their own blood.  The blood of the great and abominable church. This church is the whore of all the earth.''}
1Ne 22:14	 \Nephi{``All those that fight against Zion will be destroyed.  Every nation that wars with the house of Israel will turn one against another.  They will fall into the pit that they had dug to ensnare God's people.  Those that fight against Zion are that great whore.  That great and abominable church.  This church will tumble^ to dust.  Great will be the fall of it.''}
1Ne 22:15	 \Nephi{``Remember the prophet's words^ said:''} \Prophet{``The time soon comes when {\wicked{wicked one}} will no longer have power over the hearts^ of the children of men.  One day soon, the wicked will be burned^ as stubble.''}  
1Ne 22:16	 \Prophet{``One day, God will intervene to prevent the wicked from destroying the righteous.  In that day, the fullness of God's wrath will pour out among the children of men.''}
1Ne 22:17	 \Prophet{``The Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings will go forth.  The righteous will be preserved as the enemies are destroyed by fire.  The righteous will be saved even^ as they are surrounded by fire.''}
1Ne 22:18	 \Nephi{``Brothers, these things will happen in God's time. They will happen to men in the flesh.  Blood, fire, and vapor of smoke must come.  It will fill the earth.  And the wicked will burn.  They will burn because they harden their hearts against God.''}
1Ne 22:19	 \Nephi{``Anyone that fights against Zion will be destroyed by fire.  And the righteous will be preserved.''}
1Ne 22:20	 \Nephi{``God will prepare a prophet^ to preserve His people.  Remember the words of Moses: ''} \Moses{``The Eternal Father will send the great prophet^.  Every word this great prophet speaks will be fulfilled.  If you listen to this prophet, you will be counted among God's people.''}
1Ne 22:21	 \Nephi{``Brothers, let me tell you who Moses referred to as the great prophet.  The great prophet is the Messiah.  The Holy One of Israel.  [Jehovah will take upon flesh.  He will carry out God's will.]   He will execute judgment^ in righteousness.''}
1Ne 22:22	 \Nephi{``The righteous need not fear.  They will not be confounded.  The wicked need to fear.  They will be confounded.  Yes, the kingdom of the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  A kingdom established by the {\wicked{wicked one}} while the children of men are in the flesh.  This kingdom will be enlarged by the children of men--'}
1Ne 22:23	 \Nephi{``The kingdom of the {\wicked{wicked one}} has many churches with a similar objectives.  They enlarge themselves for worldly gain.  They want to have power and control over others.  They want to become popular in the eyes of the world.  They seek the lusts of the flesh.  They also lust for worldly things.  They do all manner of unrighteousness.  These churches belong to the kingdom of the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  They need to fear.  They will tremble and quake.  They will be brought low in the dust.  They must be consumed^ by fire as stumble.  Yes, this is what the prophet has declared.'`}  % [Isaiah 5:31? or Isaiah 33:10.5? or Isaiah 47:13.5?]
1Ne 22:24	 \Nephi{``Afterwards, the Holy One of Israel will personally reign.  He will reign in supreme authority, in might, in power, and in great glory.  The righteous will be leap with joy as a calf^ of the stall does when released to pasture.''}
1Ne 22:25	 \Nephi{``And He will gather His children from the four quarters of the earth.  He has numbered His sheep.  He knows His sheep.  And one day they will be one fold.  And He will be their Shepherd.  He will feed His sheep.  And in Him, they find green^ pastures.''}
1Ne 22:26	 \Nephi{``The {\wicked{wicked one}} will have no power.  The {\wicked{wicked one}} will be bound by the faith of the righteous. (After many years he will be briefly unbound.)  The {\wicked{wicked one}} will not have any power over the hearts of men.  The righteous will live in holiness for many years.  And the Holy One of Israel will personally reign.''}
1Ne 22:27	 \Nephi{``Brothers, all of these things will literally happen in the flesh.''}
1Ne 22:28	 \Nephi{``This invitation to repose with God is given to all nations, kindreds, tongues and people.  All that turn to God will dwell safely with the Holy One of Israel.  Repent from wickedness.  [Turn to God.  Become Righteous. And live!]''}
1Ne 22:29	 \Nephi{``I finish speaking of these things.  For now, I don't venture^ to say more.''}
1Ne 22:30	 \Nephi{``Brothers, consider these things we have discussed.  They are written on the brass plates.  I know they are true. Man must obey God's commandments.  [If you ponder these things for yourself, you can also know they are true.]''}
1Ne 22:31	 \Nephi{``My father and I are not the only ones to have taught this.  Many prophets have taught this^: If you are obedient to God's commands.  If you endure to the end.  You will be saved at the last day.  And thus it is. Amen.''}
2Ne 1:1	I (Nephi) finished teaching my brothers.  Our father, Lehi spoke^ to them.  He repeated many things to them. He reminded them that God had done many great things for them.  God brought them from land of Jerusalem to this new land. 
2Ne 1:2	Lehi also reminded my brothers about their treachery when we were on^ the \emph{great waters}.  Yes, that God had spared their^ lives.  That the seas did not swallow them up.
2Ne 1:3	And Lehi also spoke^ about this new land.  This land of promise.  This land we had obtained.  He reminded us that God had been merciful.  God warned us to flee the land of Jerusalem.
2Ne 1:4	Lehi said: \Lehi{``I have seen a vision.  I know Jerusalem has been^ destroyed.  If we had remained in Jerusalem, we also would have perished.''}
2Ne 1:5	\Lehi{``Notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise.  A land which is choice above all other lands. A land which God has consecrated^ with me should be a land for the inheritance^ of my seed.  Yes, God consecrated this land to me.  This will by the land of my children forever.  It will also be inherited by others.  Those from other countries led here by God's hand.''}
2Ne 1:6	\Lehi{``God's Spirit is in me.  I (Lehi) prophesy^ that none will come into this land unless God's hand^ brings them.''}
2Ne 1:7	\Lehi{``This land is consecrated.  If God brings them to this land, they will serve Him.  They will keep God's commandments. It will be a land of liberty for them.  They will not become captives.  If they become captives, it will because they are wicked.  This land will be blessed forever for the righteous.  This land will be cursed for the wicked.''}
2Ne 1:8	\Lehi{``For now, other nations will not know about this land.  This is God's wisdom.  Once they see it, many nations will overrun it.  And there would be no place for your inheritance.''}
2Ne 1:9	\Lehi{``I (Lehi) have been promised by God.  God promised all those^ He brings from Jerusalem will prosper.  If^ they keep God's commandments, they will prosper on the face of the land.  This land will be theirs alone to possess.  Knowledge of this land will be theirs alone.  If they^ keep God's commandments, they will be blessed on the face of this land.  None will molest them.  None will take away the land of their inheritance.  They will dwell safely forever.''}
2Ne 1:10	\Lehi{``But, they will not keep God's commandments.  They will dwindle^ in unbelief.  After receiving so many great blessings from God.  After having a knowledge of the creation of the earth.  A knowledge of the creation of all^ men.  After knowing the great and marvelous works of God since the creation of the world.  After having power given them do do all things by faith.  After having all the commandments from the beginning.  After having been brought by God's infinite goodness into this precious land of promise.  Yes, in that day.  The day they will reject the Holy One of Israel.  The day they will reject their true Messiah. The day they will reject their true Redeemer. The day they will reject their God.  In that day, God's judgments^ will fall upon them.  His judgment will fall upon our seed.''}
2Ne 1:11	\Lehi{``God will bring other peoples^ to this land.  God will give them power.  With this power, God will take the lands possessed by our seed and give it to them.  These other peoples will scatter and punish our seed.''}
2Ne 1:12	\Lehi{``Within a generation^ of the arrival of these other peoples, great judgment will be visited upon our seed.  My sons, I wish you would remember.  I wish you would listen to my words.''}
2Ne 1:13	\Lehi{``O that you would wake up! Wake up from your deep sleep! Yes, from the sleep of hell!  Shake off the awful chains that bind you!  Which are the chains that bind the children of men.  These chains will drag you captive down to the eternal gulf of misery and woe!''}
2Ne 1:14	\Lehi{``Wake up!  Arise from the dust!  Hear my words!  I am a trembling parent.  A feeble parent^ that you will soon place in a cold and silent grave.  A grave from which no traveler can return.  In just a few days, I will go the way of the earth.''}
2Ne 1:15	\Lehi{``I know that God has redeemed by soul from hell.  I have beheld God's glory.  I am encircled about eternally in the arms of His love.''}
2Ne 1:16	\Lehi{``And I wish.  I wish you would remember to observe God's statutes^. I wish you would remember God's judgments.  Your salvation has been the anxiety of my soul since^ the beginning.''}
2Ne 1:17	\Lehi{``My heart has been weighed down with sorrow from time to time.  I fear for you because you have hardened your hearts against God. I fear God will unleash the fullness of his wrath upon you.  I fear you will be destroyed forever, cut off from God's presence.''}
2Ne 1:18	\Lehi{``I fear that a curse will come upon you for many generations.  I fear that you will be visited by the sword.  I fear that you will be visited by famine.  I fear you will be hated.  I fear you will be lead according to the will of the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  I fear the {\wicked{wicked one}} with take you captive.''}
2Ne 1:19	\Lehi{``O my sons, I pray these things don't happen to you.  I pray you might be a choice and favored people.  Behold, God's will be done. God's ways are righteous.''}
2Ne 1:20	\Lehi{``And God has said:''} \God{``If you keep my commandments, you will prosper in the land.  If you do not keep my commandments, you will be cut off from my presence.''}
2Ne 1:21	\Lehi{``I wish my soul might have joy in you, my sons.  I wish I might leave this world glad in heart because of you, my sons.  I wish that I might not be brought to grief and sorrow to the grave. Therefore, Arise from the dust my sons and be men!  Be determined in one mind and in one heart.  Be united in all things.  That you may not come down into captivity.''}
2Ne 1:22	\Lehi{``That you may not be cursed with a sore cursing.  That you may not incur the displeasure of a just God upon you.  That you won't be destroyed.  Yes, destroyed in both the soul and the body!''}
2Ne 1:23	\Lehi{``Wake up, my sons! Put on the armor of righteousness!  Shake off the chains with which you are bound!  Come forth out of obscurity! Arise from the dust!''}
2Ne 1:24	\Lehi{``Rebel no more against your brother Nephi! His intentions have been noble.  He has kept God's commandments since we left Jerusalem.  He has been an instrument in God's hands.  God has used Nephi to bring us out of the land of promise.  Were it not for Nephi, we would have perished of hunger in the wilderness.  Nevertheless, you tried to kill him. Yes, he has suffered much sorrow because of you.''}
2Ne 1:25	\Lehi{``I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you.  I fear he will suffer^ again.  Behold, you have accused him that he seeks power and authority over you.  But I know that is not true.  Nephi does not seek for power nor authority over you.  He seeks for the glory of God.  He endeavors for your eternal welfare.''}
2Ne 1:26	\Lehi{``You have murmured against Nephi because he speaks plainly to you.  You say he has used severe language against you.  You say he has been angry with you.  That language you felt was severe, it was severe because of the power of the word of God.  God's power was in him.  That which you call anger was truth.  God's truth.  Nephi could not restrain himself.  Courageously speaking truth concerning your unrighteousness.''}
2Ne 1:27	\Lehi{``Truly, God's power is with him.  If Nephi commands, you must obey.  But, behold, it was not Nephi.  It was God's Spirit^ that dwelled in Nephi.  God opened Nephi's mouth and Nephi spoke God's words.  Nephi could not stop speaking the words God had given him.''}
2Ne 1:28	\Lehi{``And now, my son Laman. And also Lemuel. And Sam. And my sons who are the sons of Ishmael.  Behold, if you will listen to Nephi, you will not perish.  If you will listen to him, I leave you a blessing, even my first^ blessing.''}
2Ne 1:29	\Lehi{``But if you don't listen to him, I will take away my first blessing, even my blessing.  And this blessing will go to Nephi.''}
2Ne 1:30	\Lehi{``And now, Zoram, a word for you.  Behold, you were the servant of Laban.  Nevertheless, God has brought you with us from the land of Jerusalem.  I know that you are a true friend of my son, Nephi, forever.''}
2Ne 1:31	\Lehi{``Because you have been faithful, your seed will be blessed with Nephi's seed.  Your seed will dwell in prosperity for a long time in this land.  Nothing will harm or disturb their prosperity on the face of this land forever.  Only their own unrighteousness can hinder their prosperity.''}
2Ne 1:32	\Lehi{``Zoram, if you keep God's commandments, God will consecrate this land for the security of your seed with the seed of my son Nephi.''}
2Ne 2:1	Lehi speaking: \Lehi{``Jacob, you are my firstborn^ in the days of my tribulation.  Yes, the days in the wilderness.  In your childhood, you have suffered much.  You have suffered adversity, sorrow, and pain because of the rudeness of your brothers.''}
2Ne 2:2	\Lehi{``Nevertheless, Jacob.  My firstborn in the wilderness.  You know God's greatness.  You know God will consecrate your afflictions for your gain.''}
2Ne 2:3	\Lehi{``Your soul will be blessed.  You will dwell safely with your brother Nephi.  Your days will be spent^ in the service of your God.  I know that you are redeemed.  You are redeemed because of the righteousness of your Redeemer.  For you have seen^ that in the fullness of time, God will come to bring salvation to men.''}
2Ne 2:4	\Lehi{``And you have seen God's glory^ in your youth.  You are blessed.  Blessed even as those who will see Him in the flesh.  For the Spirit is the same yesterday, today, and forever.  And the way is prepared from the fall of man.  And salvation is free.''}
2Ne 2:5	\Lehi{``Men are instructed sufficiently.  They know good from evil.  And the law is given to men.  By this law, no flesh is justified.  In other words, by this law, men are cut off from God's presence.  By the temporal law, they were cut off.  By the spiritual law, they perish from that which is good.  They become miserable forever.''}
2Ne 2:6	\Lehi{``Redemption comes in and through the Holy Messiah.  He is full of compassion and truth.''}
2Ne 2:7	\Lehi{``The Messiah offers himself as a sacrifice for sin.  His sacrifice is to answer the ends of the law.  This answer only applies to those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit.  None else can use this sacrifice to answer the ends of the law.''}
2Ne 2:8	\Lehi{``This truth is greatly important.  It must be shared with the inhabitants^ of the earth.  They must know that no flesh  can dwell in the presence of God.  Unless the flesh is sanctified by the merits, the mercy, and the benevolence of the Holy Messiah.  The Messiah who lays down His life according to the flesh.  The Messiah who takes His flesh^ again by the power of the Spirit.  This is the process of the resurrection.  He is the first that will rise from the dead.''}
2Ne 2:9	\Lehi{``The Messiah is the firstfruits for the Eternal Father.  The Messiah will make an intercession for all of the children of men.^  Those children that believe in Him will be saved.''} 
2Ne 2:10	\Lehi{``The intercession is for all of the children of men.  This means all men will stand before God and be judged by Him.  They will be judged according to the truth and holiness which is in Him.  They will be judged by the laws that Holy One has given.  The \emph{ends of the law} demand justice: inflicting punishment as the final judgment.  Only the \emph{ends of the atonement} can answer this demand: assigning happiness as the final judgment.  Punishment and happiness^ are opposing judgments.''}
2Ne 2:11	\Lehi{``Jacob, my firstborn in the wilderness: It is necessary that there is opposition in all things.  Righteousness could not happen without wickedness.  Likewise, wickedness could not happen without righteousness.  Neither happiness^ nor misery.  Neither good nor bad.  All things must be compound (two opposites) in one.  If the body were without opposites it would remain dead forever.  It could have neither life nor death.  It could have neither corruption nor incorruption.  It could have neither happiness nor misery.  It could have neither sense nor insensibility.''}
2Ne 2:12	\Lehi{``As such^, the body would have been created for nothing.  There would have been no purpose for life. No purpose in the end for the body's creation.  This would destroy God's eternal purposes.  This would destroy God's wisdom.  This would destroy God's power.  This would destroy God's mercy.  This would destroy the justice of God.''}
2Ne 2:13	\Lehi{``If there is no law, there is no sin.  If there is no sin, there is no righteousness.  If there is no righteousness, there is no happiness.  And if there is no rightousness nor happiness, there is no punishment nor misery.  And if these things are not, there is no God.  And if there is no God, we are not.  And the earth is not.  For there could not have been a creation of things.  Neither to act or be acted upon.  Therefore nothing would^ exist.''} 
2Ne 2:14	\Lehi{``And now my son(s)^, I outline this profound truth for your profit and learning.  There is a God^.  God created all things.  God created the heavens and the earth.  God created all things that exist in the heavens and earth.  God created both things to act and things to be acted upon.''}
2Ne 2:15	\Lehi{``After God created our first^  parents.  After God created the beasts of the field.  After God created the fowls of the air.  In fine, after God created all things.  These things needed opposition.  Opposition is needed for God^ to bring about His eternal purposes for man.  For example, the bitter fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil is in opposition^ to the sweet fruit of the tree of life. ''}
2Ne 2:16	\Lehi{``God gave^ to man his agency.  Man^ should act for himself.  How can a man act for himself?  This requires that he has choices.  He can be enticed by one or the other.''}
2Ne 2:17	\Lehi{``I, Lehi, according to my knowledge.  Based on the things I have read.  Based on the things that are written.  I suppose^ that an angel of God had fallen^ from heaven and became the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  This angel became evil in his attempt to usurp God.''}
2Ne 2:18	\Lehi{``Because the {\wicked{wicked one}} had fallen, he had become miserable forever.  This is why the {\wicked{wicked one}} wants all mankind to be miserable.  The {\wicked{wicked one}} is the fleeing \emph{nachash}^ (\emph{Lucifuge}).  The {\wicked{wicked one}} is the father^ of all lies.  The {\wicked{wicked one}} said to Eve:''} \wickedone{``Partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge found here in the middle of the garden.  You will not die.  You will become like God, knowing good and evil.''}
2Ne 2:19	\Lehi{``Adam and Eve partook^ of this fruit.  And God had to cast them out of the Garden of Eden.  They had to till the earth.''}
2Ne 2:20	\Lehi{``And Adam and Even brought forth children.  Yes, even the family of all the earth.''}
2Ne 2:21	\Lehi{``And the days of the children of men were^ prolonged.  This was agreeable to God's will.  This state became a state of probation.  Their time was lengthened.  This is according to the commandments God gave to the children of men.  God commanded all men to repent.  God showed all men that they were lost.  They were^ lost because of the transgression of their parents.''}
2Ne 2:22	\Lehi{``If Adam had not transgressed, he would not have fallen.  He would have remained^ in the garden of Eden.  All things created would remain in the same state.  The same state there were in after they were created.  They must have remained forever.  Nothing would change.''}
2Ne 2:23	\Lehi{``And they would have no^ children.  They would have remained in a state of innocence.  They would have no joy because they didn't know misery.  They would not do any good, because they didn't know sin.''}
2Ne 2:24	\Lehi{``Behold, all things have been done in God's^ wisdom.  He who knows all things.''}
2Ne 2:25	\Lehi{``Adam fell that men might be.  Men are, that they might have joy.''}
2Ne 2:26	\Lehi{``The Messiah comes in the fullness of time.  He comes to redeem the children of men from the fall.  Because they are redeemed from the fall, they have become free forever.  They know^ good from evil.  They act for themselves and are not acted upon upon.  In the great and last day (judgment), they may lose this ability to act as punishment of the law.  God's commandments must be kept.''}
2Ne 2:27	\Lehi{``Men are free according to the flesh. All things are given to men that may benefit them to accomplish their purpose.  They are free to choose liberty and eternal life.  This is possible through the great Mediator of all men (the Messiah).  They are free to choose captivity and death.  This is possible through the captivity and power of the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  The {\wicked{wicked one}} seeks for all men to be miserable as he is miserable.''} 
2Ne 2:28	\Lehi{``And now, my sons^, I want you to look to the great Mediator (the Messiah).  Listen to God's great commandments.  Be faithful to God's words.  Choose eternal life, according to the will of Holy Spirit.''}
2Ne 2:29	\Lehi{``Don't choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh. Evil can dwell in the flesh.  This gives the spirit of the {\wicked{wicked one}} power to captivate^.  The power to bring you down to hell.  The {\wicked{wicked one}} wants to reign over you in his own^ kingdom.''}
2Ne 2:30	\Lehi{`I (Lehi) spoke these words to all of you my sons.  These are the last days of my probation.  I have chose the good part.  According to the words^ of the prophet.  My only remaining concern is the everlasting welfare of your souls.  Amen.''}
2Ne 3:1	Lehi^ speaking: \Lehi{``Joseph, you are my last born. You were born in the wilderness. In the days of my tribulation.  In the days of my greatest^ sorrow.  Your mother gave birth to you.''}
2Ne 3:2	\Lehi{``May God also consecrate this land for your sake.  May it be a most precious land for you.  May it be an inheritance for you and your seed.  Your seed will be secure with your^ brothers.  This promise will be forever yours if you keep the God's commandments.''}
2Ne 3:3	\Lehi{``Now, Joseph, my lastborn.  I have brought you out of the wilderness of my tribulations.  May God bless you forever.  May He bless your seed that it will not be utterly destroyed.''}
2Ne 3:4	\Lehi{``You are the fruit of my loins.  I am a descendant of Joseph.  Joseph who was carried captive to Egypt.  And great were God's covenants that He made with Joseph.''}
2Ne 3:5	\Lehi{``Joseph truly saw our day.  Joseph had obtained a promise from God.  Joseph was promised that the fruit of his loins would be righteous.  Yes, that Joseph would raise up a righteous branch to the house of Israel.  Not the branch of Messiah.  But a branch broken^ off.  Broken off, but to be remembered by God.  In the last days, the Messiah will manifest unto this branch of Joseph.  In the spirit of power, this branch will be brought out of the darkness to the light.  Yes, out of hidden darkness and captivity to freedom.''}
2Ne 3:6	\Lehi{``Joseph of old truly testified of this:''} \Joseph{``God will raise up a seer.  This seer will be a choice seer^ for the fruit of my loins.''}
2Ne 3:7	\Joseph{``God had told me this:''} \God{``A choice seer will I raise up from the fruit of your loins.  He shall be esteemed highly among the fruit of your loins.  And to this seer, I give commandment that he will do a work for the fruit of you loins (his brothers).  This work will be of great worth to them.  It will bring them to a remembrance of the covenants I have made with your fathers.''}
2Ne 3:8	\God{``I will give him a commandment to do no other work.  This is the work the seer is commanded to do.  I will make him great in My eyes.  He shall do My work.''}
2Ne 3:9	\God{``This seer will be like Moses.  Like Moses he will deliver My people.''}
2Ne 3:10	\God{``Moses I raise up to deliver your people out of the land of Egypt.''}
2Ne 3:11	\God{``This seer^ I will raise up from the fruit of your loins.  I will give him power to bring My word to the seed of your loins.  He will also convince them of My word that was already available to them.''}
2Ne 3:12	\God{``The fruit of your loins will write.  The fruit of the loins of Judah will write.  Those writings will grow together.  The truths of these writings will confound false doctrines.  Will prevent contentions.  Will establish peace among the fruit of your loins.  Will bring them to the knowledge of their fathers in the last days.  Will bring them to a remembrance of My covenants with them.''}
2Ne 3:13	\God{``This seer will start out lowly.  I will strengthen him.  His work will commence the restoration of the house of Israel.  In that day when my marvelous work and wonder will commence among all my people.''} 
2Ne 3:14	\Lehi{``And Joseph explained:''} \Joseph{``God will bless this seer.  Many will seek to destroy him.  But they will be confounded.  I have obtained this promise from God concerning this seer.  This seer raising up from the fruit of my loins.  It will be fulfilled.  I am sure God will fulfill this promise.''}
2Ne 3:15	\Joseph{``The name of this seer is my name^.  It will also be the name of the seer's father.  Like me, this seer will bring my people unto salvation.  By the power of God.  This seer will bring forth God's words^ by His hand.''}
2Ne 3:16	\Joseph{``I am sure of this thing.  Even as I am sure of the promise of Moses.  For God told me:''} \God{``I will preserve your seed forever.''}
2Ne 3:17	\God{``I will raise up a Moses.  I will give him a rod that has My power.  I will give him the faculties of the mind to enable him to write.  I will not loose his tongue.  He will not speak much.  I will not^ make him mighty in speaking.  In fact, I will write My law for him.  With the finger of My own hand I will write^ the law.  I will also give him a spokesman^.''}
2Ne 3:18	\God{``I will raise up another seer from the fruit of your loins.  I will also give him a spokesman.  I will command this seer to write the words of the history of the fruit of your loins.  These words will go forth to the fruit of your loins.  The spokesman^ of your loins will declare it.''}
2Ne 3:19	\God{``And the words which he shall write I find appropriate in My wisdom to be sent to the fruit of your loins. I know the faith of the fruit of your loins.  It is as if the authors of these words have cried from the dust for these words to be delivered.''} 
2Ne 3:20	\God{``These words will cry^ from the dust.  Yes, these words will cry repentance to their brothers.  Even after many generations have past.  This cry will go forth.  Even according to the simpleness of the words.''}
2Ne 3:21	\God{``This is because of the faith of the authors of these words.  The words will go forth out of My mouth unto their brothers who are also the fruit of your loins.  The weakness of their words I will make strong in their faith.  I will remember my covenant which I have made with your^ fathers.''}
2Ne 3:22	\Lehi{``Now, my son Joseph^, this is how Joseph of old did prophesy.''}
2Ne 3:23	\Lehi{``Because of this covenant, you are blessed.  Your seed will not^ be destroyed.  Your seed will hearken unto the words of the book.''}
2Ne 3:24	\Lehi{``And one mighty among your seed will rise up.  He will do much good.  He will do good in word and deed.  He will be an instrument in God's hands.  He will have exceeding faith.  He will work mighty wonders.  He will do great things in God's eyes.  He will bring about the restoration of the house of Israel.  He will restore^ the seed of your brothers.''}
2Ne 3:25	\Lehi{``I bless you Joseph.  You are^ little.  Listen to the words of your brother Nephi^.  If you do so, these promises which I have spoken will be fulfilled. Remember the words of your dying father.  Amen.''}
2Ne 4:1	I (Nephi) speak about the prophecies my father shared.  Those prophecies about Joseph.  Joseph who was carried into Egypt.
2Ne 4:2	Joseph (of Old) truly prophesied concerning all of his seed.  Of prophecies written, there are not many greater than the prophecies Joseph wrote.  Joseph prophesied about us.  He prophesied about our future generations.  His prophecies are written^ upon the brass plates.
2Ne 4:3	After Lehi finished speaking about Joseph's prophecies, he called for his grandchildren.  He first called for the children of Laman^ (his sons and daughters). Lehi spoke to them: \Lehi{``Behold my sons and daughters.  The sons and daughters of my firstborn (Laman).  Please listen to my words.''} 
2Ne 4:4	\Lehi{``God has said:''} \God{``If you keep My commandments you will prosper in the land.  If you do not keep My commandments you will be cut off from My presence.''}
2Ne 4:5	\Lehi{``I cannot go to my grave until I bless you. You my sons and daughters.  I know that if you were taught correctly, you would not depart from the truth.''}
2Ne 4:6	\Lehi{``I hope you are not cursed.  But if you are, I bless you.  I bless that the curse will be taken from you and be placed upon the heads of your parents.  May they answer for this curse.''}
2Ne 4:7	\Lehi{``Because of my blessing, God will not allow you to perish.  God will be merciful to you and your seed forever.''}
2Ne 4:8	And my father (Lehi) finished speaking to the children of Laman.  Next, he asked for the children of Lemuel to be brought to him.
2Ne 4:9	Lehi spoke to them: \Lehi{``Behold my sons and daughters.  The sons and daughters of my second son (Lemuel).  Please listen to my words. I leave you the same blessing I left the children of Laman (your cousins).  You will not be utterly destroyed.  In the end, your seed will be blessed.''} 
2Ne 4:10	And my father (Lehi) finished speaking to the children of Lemuel.  Next, he asked for the sons of Ishmael (and all of Ishmael's household) to be brought to him.
2Ne 4:11	And my father (Lehi) finished speaking to the household of Ishmael.  Next, he spoke to Sam: \Lehi{``You are blessed Sam!  Your seed is blessed.  You will inherit the land^ like your brother Nephi.  Your seed^ will be numbered with Nephi's seed.  You will be like your brother.  Your seed will be like Nephi's seed.  You will be blessed in all your days.''}
2Ne 4:12	And my father finished speaking to all^ of his household.  He spoke his final words to them.  He shared the feelings of his heart.  He spoke by the power of the Spirit which was in him.  Lehi waxed old.  And Lehi^ died.  Lehi was buried^.
2Ne 4:13	After Lehi's death, Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael were angry with me.  They were angry because God's admonitions^ I did speak to them.  This was not many days after Lehi's death. 
2Ne 4:14	I (Nephi) was powerfully compelled^ to speak to them.  Before Lehi died, I had spoken many things to them.  My father had spoken many things to them.  All of these things my father and I spoke are written.  They are written on my other plates.  Greater detail of my history are written on these other plates.
2Ne 4:15	On these plates, I write the things of the soul.  I also write many scriptures which I find on the brass plates.  My soul delights in the scriptures.  My heart ponders them.  I write them down for the learning and profit of my^ children.
2Ne 4:16	My soul delights in the things of God.  My heart ponders them continually.  I ponder on the things^ I have seen and heard.
2Ne 4:17	God is great.  In His goodness He has show me many things.  Many of His great and marvelous works.  Yet, I am not perfect.  My heart cries out: \Nephi{``O wretched man that I am!''}  Yes, my heart sorrows because of my flesh.  My soul grieves because of my^ iniquities.
2Ne 4:18	I am encompassed about by temptations and sins.  These temptations and sins easily beset^ me.
2Ne 4:19	And when I rejoice, my heart groans because of my sins.  Nevertheless, I know whom I have trusted.
2Ne 4:20	My God has been my support.  God has led me through my afflictions in the wilderness.  God preserved me upon the \emph{many waters} of the great deep.
2Ne 4:21	God has filled me with His love.  Even unto the consuming of my flesh.
2Ne 4:22	God has confounded my enemies.  Even unto causing them to quake before me.
2Ne 4:23	God has heard my cries by day.  God has given me knowledge by visions in the night-time.
2Ne 4:24	By day I wax bold in mighty prayer to God.  Yes, my voice I have sent up to the heavens. And the angels have come down and ministered to me.
2Ne 4:25	On the wings^ of God's Spirit, my body has been carried away to exceedingly high mountains.  My eyes have seen great things.  Yes, things too great for man.  Therefore, God has compelled^ me not to write them down.
2Ne 4:26	I have seen such great things.  I have seen the condescension of God to the children of men.  I have seen God visit men with His great mercy.  \Nephi{``Why should my heart weep?  Why does my soul linger in the valley of sorrow?  Why does my flesh waste away?  Why does my strength weaken?  All because of my^ afflictions.''}
2Ne 4:27	\Nephi{``Why should I yield to sin^ because of my flesh?  Yes, why should I give way to temptations?  The temptations give the evil one place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul?  Why am I angry because of my enemy?''}
2Ne 4:28	\Nephi{``Awake my soul!  Don't droop in sin.  Rejoice, my heart!  Don't give a place anymore for the enemy of my soul.''}
2Ne 4:29	\Nephi{``Don't be angry again because of my enemies^.  Don't get discouraged^ because of mine afflictions.''}
2Ne 4:30	\Nephi{``Rejoice, my heart!''} Cry unto God and say: \Nephi{``O God, I will praise You forever. Yes my soul will rejoice in you, my God, the rock of my salvation.''}
2Ne 4:31	\Nephi{``O God, will you redeem my soul?  Will You deliver me out of the hands of my enemies?  Will you cause me to tremble at the appearance of sin?''}
2Ne 4:32	\Nephi{``May the gates of hell be shut forever before me.  My heart is broken.  My spirit is contrite.  O God, please do not shut the gates of Your righteousness before me.  Bless me that I may walk in the path of the low valley.  That I may be confined to the plain road!''}
2Ne 4:33	\Nephi{``O God, encircle me in the robe of your righteousness! O God, make a way for me to escape^ before my enemies!  Please make the path straight before me.  Don't allow stumbling blocks to impede my way.  Please let the path be clear before me.  Hedge not my way.  But hedge the way of my enemies.''}
2Ne 4:34	\Nephi{``O God, I have trusted You.  And I will trust in you forever.  I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh.  For I know that cursed is he that puts his trust in the arm of flesh.  Yes, cursed is he that puts his trust in man.  Or makes flesh his arm.''}
2Ne 4:35	I know God will give liberally to him that asks.  Yes, my God will give me what I ask.  If I ask not amiss.  Therefore, I will lift up my voice unto God: \Nephi{``I will cry unto You, my God. You are my rock of my righteousness.  Behold my voice will ascend to you forever.  You are my rock and my everlasting God.  Amen^.''}
2Ne 5:1	I (Nephi) did cry to God in prayer.  Because of the anger of my brothers.
2Ne 5:2	Their anger did increase against me.  My brothers did seek to kill me.
2Ne 5:3	Yes, my brothers did murmur against me saying: \Brothers{``Our younger brother thinks^ he will rule over us.  We have had many tribulations because of him.  Let's kill him.  Let's kill him so he can't afflict us any more with his words.  Behold, we will not have him to be our ruler.  Rights of ruling belong to us.  We are the older brothers.  We should rule over this people.''}
2Ne 5:4	Now I don't write everything on these small plates they said^.  Suffice me to say, my brothers wanted to kill me.   
2Ne 5:5	God warned me.  God commanded me to depart from^ my brothers.  God told me to flee into the wilderness^.  God told me to take everyone with me that wanted to go.
2Ne 5:6	I did as God commanded.  I took my family.  I also took Zoram and his family.  I took Sam (my older brother) and his family.  I also took^ Jacob and Joseph (my younger brothers).  And my^ sisters.  And I also took anyone^ else that wanted to go with me.  If they went with me, they had to listen to me.  They had to believe God had chosen me.  That God had warned me.
2Ne 5:7	We did take our tents.  We did take everything that was possible^ for us.  We did journey in the wilderness for the space of many days.  After we journeyed for the space of many days, we did pitch our tents.
2Ne 5:8	And my people wanted us to call this place Nephi.  So we called it the land of Nephi.
2Ne 5:9	And everyone that followed me to this place took my name.  They called themselves the people of Nephi.
2Ne 5:10	And we did observe to keep the judgments, statutes, and commandments.  In all things, we observed God's commands.  We observed the law of Moses.
2Ne 5:11	And God was with us.  We did prosper exceedingly.  We did sow seeds.  We did reap again in abundance.  We began to raise flocks^, herds, and animals of every kind.
2Ne 5:12	I also brought the records written on the brass plates.  I brought the \emph{Liahona} that was prepared by God's hand.  It was prepared for my father as I have previously explained.
2Ne 5:13	We began to prosper exceedingly.  We multiplied in the land.
2Ne 5:14	I also took^ the sword of Laban.  After the manner of this sword, I made^ many swords.  We didn't want our enemies to find^ us and destroy us.  [As the Jews call unbelievers \emph{Gentiles},] we began calling our enemies \emph{Lamanites}.  This name reminds me and my people of my first enemies: my brothers Laman and Lemeul.  They hated me.  They hated my children.  They hated all^ of my people.
2Ne 5:15	In the land of Nephi, I did teach my people skills of various trades.  I taught them to build^ buildings.  I taught them to work in all manner of wood.  I taught them to work with iron, copper, brass, steel, gold, silver, and precious ores.  All of these materials were in great abundance.
2Ne 5:16	With my people, I did build^ a temple for Jehovah.  I did construct it after the manner of Jehovah's temple^ built by Solomon.  It did not have as many precious^ things as Jehovah's temple built by Solomon.  As such, it could not be built exactly like Jehovah's temple built by Solomon.  Nevertheless, the manner of construction was like Jehovah's temple built by Solomon.  The workmanship of the temple we built for Jehovah was exceedingly^ fine.
2Ne 5:17	I encouraged my people to be industrious^.  I encouraged them to follow my example as an artisan.  I trained them to labor with their hands.
2Ne 5:18	And the people wanted me to be their king.  But I did not want the people be ruled by a king.  Nevertheless, I did^ for them according to that which was in my power and they considered me their king.
2Ne 5:19	God's words to my brothers were fulfilled.  I was a ruler and teacher^.  And previously, I had been the ruler and teacher over my brothers.  As God had commanded me.  Until they tried to kill me so we separated ourselves from them.
2Ne 5:20	God's word was fulfilled.  He told me: \God{``If your brothers will not listen to your words, they will be cut off from My presence.''} And it happened.  My brothers abandoned their beliefs^ of the true living God.
2Ne 5:21	And God caused a cursing to come upon my brothers.  Yes, a sore cursing.  Because of their iniquity.  They had hardened their hearts against God.  They had become like^ flint.  My brothers used to be white^, exceedingly fair and delightsome.  Now, they had adopted local traditions of painting^ their bodies black and their mouths red like the beasts of the forest.   They had become dark and loathsome.  As a result, my people were not interested^ in marrying^ these nonbelievers.
2Ne 5:22	God said: \God{``I will cause that your brothers and their seed will be disgusting and detestable to your people.  This will not change unless they repent.''}
2Ne 5:23	\God{``Cursed is the seed of the man that mixes with their seed.  If they intermarry, they will be cursed^ as Laman's seed is cursed.''} God spoke it. And so it will be done.
2Ne 5:24	They used their intellect mischievously to gain influence and power in the land without working with their hands.  They became an idle people.  They would disturb the harmony of the forest by capturing beasts of prey^.  They would use these beasts to torment the innocent.  
2Ne 5:25	God warned me: \God{``They will be a bane to your seed.  They will stir up your seed so your seed will remember Me.  If your seed does not remember Me (does not listen to Me), I will allow them to scourge your seed even unto destruction.''}
2Ne 5:26	And I did consecrate^ Jacob and Joseph.  I consecrated them to be priests and teachers over^ the land of my people.
2Ne 5:27	We lived in a happy^ manner.
2Ne 5:28	Thirty years^ have transpired since we left Jerusalem.
2Ne 5:29	I had kept a record of my people  I kept these records on my larger plates.
2Ne 5:30	God commanded me: \God{``Make other plates.  On these (smaller) plates engrave spiritual matters. Things I would declare good.  That these writings may be for a profit to your people.''} 
2Ne 5:31	I obeyed God's command.  I went and made these (smaller) plates.  I am writing the spiritual things on them^.
2Ne 5:32	I wrote down what I esteem to be pleasing to God.  If my people are pleased with things of God. They will be pleased with the writings on these plates.
2Ne 5:33	If my people wants to know details about our history.  They particulars can be found if they search my (larger) plates.
2Ne 5:34	It suffices me to say that now forty^ years have transpired since we left Jerusalem.  We have had^ wars and contentions with our enemies the \emph{Lamanites}.
2Ne 6:1	These are the words of Jacob, the brother of Nephi.  This is what Jacob said to the people of Nephi:
2Ne 6:2	\Jacob{``Behold, my beloved brothers.  I (Jacob) have been called by God.  I have been ordained after the manner of His hold order.  My brother Nephi has consecrated me.  The same Nephi you look to as your king or protector^.  The same Nephi you depend on for your safety.  And you know that I have told you exceedingly many things.''}
2Ne 6:3	\Jacob{``Nevertheless, I speak^ unto you again.  I am concerned for the welfare of your souls.  I have great anxiety because of you.  And you are aware of this.  I have exhorted you diligently.  I have taught you the words of my^ father.  I have spoken to you concerning everything that has been written.  I have taught you many things starting with the creation of the world.''}
2Ne 6:4	\Jacob{``Now, I want to tell you about things that are to come.  I will read the words of Isaiah.  And these words, my brother Nephi^ desires that I share with you.  I share these things for your sakes.  That you may learn and glorify^ the name of God.''}
2Ne 6:5	\Jacob{``These words I read are from Isaiah.  Isaiah is speaking about the house of Israel.  You can liken these words to yourselves.  For you are^ of the house of Israel.''}
2Ne 6:6	\Jacob{``These are the words of Isaiah:''} \Isaiah``{These are the words of God:''} \God{``Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles.  I will setup a banner^ to the people.  And the Gentiles will bring your sons in their arms.  And the Gentiles will carry your daughters on their shoulders.''}
2Ne 6:7	\God{``Kings will be your nourishing^ fathers.  Queens will be your nursing mothers.  They will bow down to the earth and venerate you.  And you will know that I am God. I made this happen.  Those that wait for Me will not be ashamed.''}
2Ne 6:8	\Jacob{``Now I (Jacob) want to explain these words.  God has shown me what they mean.  We have come^ from Jerusalem.  Those that remained there have been killed or carried away as captives.''}
2Ne 6:9	\Jacob{``God has shown me that the captives will return again to Jerusalem.  And God will manifest Himself to the house of Israel in the flesh.  God, the Holy One of Israel, will be scourged by them.  They will crucify their God (in the flesh).  These are the words an angel shared with me.''}
2Ne 6:10	\Jacob{``After the house of Israel hardens their hearts.  After they rejected the God in the flesh.  God will send His judgments to them.  They will be smitten and afflicted.''}
2Ne 6:11	\Jacob{``They will be driven to and fro.  The angel explained this to me.  Many will be afflicted in the flesh.  Not all will be allowed to perish; they are saved by the prayers of the faithful.  Nevertheless, they will be scattered, and smitten, and hated.  One day, God will be merciful to them.  They will come to the knowledge of their Redeemer.  They will be gathered^ together again to the lands of their inheritance.''}
2Ne 6:12	\Jacob{``Blessed are the Gentiles.  Those that Isaiah wrote about.  Behold, if the Gentiles will repent and not fight against Zion.  This means the Gentiles^ that did not unite themselves to that great and abominable church.  These Gentiles will be saved.  God will fulfill his covenants which He made to his children.  And God cause the prophet Isaiah to write these things.  To remind God's people of His covenants.''}
2Ne 6:13	\Jacob{``Those that fight against Zion.  Those that fight against the covenant poeple of God.  They will be brought low.  And God's people will not be ashamed.  Those that wait for God.  Those that still wait^ for the coming of the Messiah.''}
2Ne 6:14	\Jacob{``Behold, according to Isaiah's words, the Messiah will again try to recover them.  A second time God will reveal Himself as the Messiah.  This time, He will manifest Himself in great power^ and glory.  He will destroy their enemies.  And they will finally believe in Him.  And if they believe in Him, He will not destroy them.''}
2Ne 6:15	\Jacob{``And those that do not believe in Him will be destroyed.  They will be destroyed by fire.  They will be destroyed by tempests.  They will be destroyed by earthquakes.  They will be destroyed by bloodsheds^.  They will be destroyed by pestilence.  They will be destroyed by famine.  And they will know that God has dominion over this earth.  That He is the Holy One of Israel.''}
2Ne 6:16	(From Isaiah): \Isaiah{``Will the prey be taken from the mighty?  Will the lawful captives^ be delivered?''}
2Ne 6:17	\Isaiah{``God has promised:''} \God{``Even the captives of the mighty will will be freed.  Even the prey of the terrible will be delivered.''}  \Isaiah{``The Mighty God will deliver His covenant people.  God has promised^:''} \God{``I will content with those that contend with you.''}
2Ne 6:18	\God{``And I will feed those that oppress you with their own flesh.  They will be made drunk with their own blood.  As if it were sweet wine.  All flesh will know that I am God.  I am the Savior and the Redeemer.  I am the Mighty One^ of Jacob.''}
2Ne 7:1	(Jacob continues reading from Isaiah, God is speaking:) \God{``Have I put you away? Have I cast you off forever?  If so, where is the bill of your mother's divorcement?  To whom have I put you away?  To which of My creditors^ have I sold you?  Behold, you have sold yourselves with your own iniquities! Yes, because of your transgressions your mother is sent away.''}
2Ne 7:2	\God{``When I came, there was no man.  When I called, there was no one to answer.  O House of Israel!  Is my hand shortened that I cannot redeem?  Do you think I have no power to deliver?  At my rebuke, I can dry up the sea.  I can make^ their rivers a wilderness.  I can make their fish stink because the waters dried up.  They die from thirst.''}
2Ne 7:3	\God{``I clothe the heavens with blackness.  I make them dress in mouring garments.''}
2Ne 7:4	\Isaiah{``God has given me^ the tongue of the learned.  He did so that I may weary^ you with God's word O house of Israel.  Every morning, God stirs me with ideas.  I listen and learn even more.''}
2Ne 7:5	\Isaiah{``God has opened my ear.  I was not rebellious.  I did not backtrack from Him.''}
2Ne 7:6	\Isaiah{``I gave my back to Him.  I was beaten by haters.  I gave my cheeks to Him.  I was struck by haters.  I gave my beard to Him.  The haters pulled out my beard.  Yet I did not hide my face in shame even when they did spit upon me.''}
2Ne 7:7	\Isaiah{``God will help me.  I will not be confounded.  I have set my face as flint^.  I know that I am not ashamed.''}
2Ne 7:8	\Isaiah{``God is near.  God justifies me.  Who then, will contend with me?  Let us^ stand together.  Who is mine adversary?  Let him come near me.  I will smite him with the strength of my mouth.''}
2Ne 7:9	\Isaiah{``For God will help me.  If they condemn me, they will be cursed.  They will wax old like a garment.  The moth will eat them up.''}
2Ne 7:10	\Isaiah{``Who among you fear God? Who obeys the voice of God's servant? Good. Who walks is the darkness^ and has no light?  Not good.  You should walk in God's light.  You should rely on God.''}
2Ne 7:11	\Isaiah{``Yet some will kindle their own fire.  They will encircle themselves about with its sparks.  They will walk in the light of their own fire. They^ will walk in the sparks which they kindled.  God's hand will deliver a judgment: they will lie down in sorrow.''}
2Ne 8:1	(Jacob continues reading from Isaiah, God is speaking:) \God{``Listen to me, you that follow righteousness.  Look to the rock from where you were hewn.  Look to the hole of the well from where you were thrust out.''}
2Ne 8:2	\God{``Look to your father, Abraham.  Look to Sarah^, she that gave birth to you.  I called Abraham specifically.  I blessed him with an abundant posterity.''}
2Ne 8:3	\Isaiah{``God will comfort Zion.  God will comfort Zion in her waste places.  God will make her^ wilderness like Eden.  Yes, God will make her desert like His own garden.  Therein, joy and gladness will be found.  Voices of thanksgiving and the sound of music will be heard.''}
2Ne 8:4	\God{``Listen to me, my people.  Give ear to me, O my nation.  I will create the law.  It will be a light established for my people.  From it,  I will make my judgement.''}
2Ne 8:5	\God{``Victory is near.  Salvation has gone forth.  My arm will judge the people.  The isles will wait for Me.  They will trust in My arm.''}
2Ne 8:6	\God{``Lift your eyes to the heavens.  Now look down to the earth below you.  Ask yourself, which of these created you?   Those of the earth will die like a gnat, but those of heaven will live forever.  My salvation^ will be forever.  My victory will never fail.''}
2Ne 8:7	\God{``Listen to Me, you that know righteousness.  In your hearts I have written My law.  Fear not the reproach of men.  Do not be afraid of their revilings.  You are My people.''}
2Ne 8:8	\God{``Those that revile you will be eaten up, like a moth eats a garment.  Like a worm eats wool.  But My victory will be forever.  My salvation is for all generations of time and for all eternity.''}
2Ne 8:9	\Isaiah{``Wake up!  Wake up!  Put on strength, O arm of God.  Awake as in the ancient days.  Are You not He that cut Rehob^?  Yes, did You not slay this vile sea monster?''}
2Ne 8:10	\Isaiah{``Are you not He that dried the sea?  That dried the waters of the great deep.  Did You not make a way^ for the ransomed to pass over the depths of the sea?''}
2Ne 8:11	\Isaiah{``God's redeemed will return.  They will come singing to Zion.  Everlasting joy and holiness will be on their heads.  They will obtain gladness and joy.  Sorrow and mourning will exist no more.''}
2Ne 8:12	\God{``I am He.  I am He that comforts You.   Why are you then afraid of man?  Men who die? Why are you afraid of the son of man?   Who will wither like the grass?''}
2Ne 8:13	\God{``How can you forget your God, Your maker?  I have stretched forth the heavens.  I laid the foundations of the earth. And you have feared continually every day.  You fear the fury of the oppressor.  You fear as if he can destroy you?  Where is the fury of the oppressor?''}
2Ne 8:14	\God{``The exiled captive hurries.  He wants to be loosed.  He does not want to die in the pit.  Nor does he want his bread to fail.''}
2Ne 8:15	\God{``I am the Lord, your God! I divided the sea and the waves roared.  The Lord of Hosts is My name.''}
2Ne 8:16	\God{``I put My words in your mouth.  I have covered you in the shadow of My hand.  I will plant^ a new heaven.  I will lay foundations for a new earth.  I will say to Zion: Behold, you are my people.''}
2Ne 8:17	\God{``Wake up!  Wake up!  Stand up, O Jerusalem!  You have drunk from the cup of God's fury.  You are drunk from the dregs of this terrible cup.  You have drunk every last drop.''}
2Ne 8:18	\God{``There are none to guide you in this state.  None among all the sons you brought forth.  Of all your sons, none take you by the hand.''} 
2Ne 8:19	\God{``These two sons come to you.  Who will feel sorry for you.  Your desolation.  Your destruction.  The famine and the sword.  By whom will I comfort you?''} 
2Ne 8:20	\Isaiah{``All your sons have fainted.  They lie dead at the end of every street.  Except for these two^ sons.  These two are raging like wild bulls caught in a trap.  They are full of God's fury.  They rebuke the mighty ones.''}
2Ne 8:21	\Isaiah{``Hear now this.  You that are afflicted.  You that are drunk, but not drunk from wine:''}
2Ne 8:22	\Isaiah{``Thus says your God.  Your God that pleads for the cause of His people:''} \God{``Behold, I have taken the cup^ out of your trembling hand.  The cup that contains the dregs of My fury.  You will not have to drink from it again.''}
2Ne 8:23	\God{``But I will put the cup in the hand of those that afflict you.  Those who commanded your soul:''} \Some{``Bow down, that we may go over.''}  \God{``Those who would walk over you.  Those that laid your body on the ground of the street.  Those would walk over you.''}
2Ne 8:24	\Isaiah{``Wake up!  Wake up! Put on your strength, O Zion.  Put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city.  From now on, the uncircumcised and the unclean will not longer enter your city.''}
2Ne 8:25	\Isaiah{``Shake yourself from the dust! Arise! Inhabit the land, O Jerusalem.  Loose yourself from the bands of your neck, O captive daughter of Zion!''}
2Ne 9:1	(Jacob speaking:) \Jacob{``Now, my beloved brothers.  I have read these things.  I want you to know about God's covenants.  He made covenants with all the house of Israel.''}
2Ne 9:2	\Jacob{``God has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of His holy prophets.  He has spoken since the beginning.  He has spoken from generation to generation.  He will speak until they will be restored to the true church.  They will be restored to the fold of God.  For they will be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance.  They will be established in their lands of promise.''}
2Ne 9:3	\Jacob{``Behold, my beloved brothers.  I tell you these things that you may rejoice.  That you may lift up your heads forever.  That God will bless your children forever.''}
2Ne 9:4	\Jacob{``For I know you have searched much.  Many of you wanted to know about the things to come.  I know that you know that our flesh must waste away and die.  Nevertheless, in our bodies we will see God.''}
2Ne 9:5	\Jacob{``Yes, I know that in the body, God will show himself to those in Jerusalem.  The place we came from.  Of all^ possible places, it is expedient that He should be among them.   The great Creator found it necessary that He suffered himself.  He became subject to man in the flesh. He should die for all men.  He did this that all men might be subject to Him.''}
2Ne 9:6	\Jacob{``All men must die.  To fulfill the merciful plan of the great Creator, men must live again.  Therefore, there must be a power of resurrection.  The resurrection is needed^ because of the fall of man.  And the fall came about because of the transgression (of Adam and Eve).  Because mankind was fallen they were cut off from God's presence.''}  
2Ne 9:7	\Jacob{``There needs to be an infinite^ atonement.  If the atonement were not infinite, this corruption could not be replaced with incorruption.  The first judgment, because of the transgression.  This judgment would have remained forever.  And if this happened, the flesh of man would have laid down and rot and crumbe to its mother earth.  The body would rise no more.''}
2Ne 9:8	\Jacob{``O the wisdom of God!  He is full of mercy and compassion!  Behold, if the flesh would rise no more, our spirits would become subject to the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  Yes, the one who fell from the Eternal Father's presence.  He would claim us, and we would rise no more.''}
2Ne 9:9	\Jacob{``Our spirits would have become like his.  We would have become servants^ to the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  We would be shut out from God's presence.  We would remain with the father of lies (the {\wicked{wicked one}}).  We would be miserable as he is miserable.  The {\wicked{wicked one}} that misled our first parents.  The {\wicked{wicked one}} that transforms himself to appear to be an angel of light.  The {\wicked{wicked one}} that deceives the children of men.  The {\wicked{wicked one}} that convinces them to murder and perform all manner of secret works^ of darkness.  The {\wicked{wicked one}} that entices them to make evil oaths, even secret combinations.''}
2Ne 9:10	\Jacob{``O how great the goodness of our God.  God prepared a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster.  Yes, that monster is death (of the body).  That monster is hell (death of the spirit).''}
2Ne 9:11	\Jacob{``God will deliver us.  The grave will deliver up its dead.  The temporal death will be overcome.  It will be overcome by the Holy One of Israel.''}
2Ne 9:12	\Jacob{``On the one^ side, spirit prison must also deliver up its dead.  Spiritual death is hell.  And hell will deliver up its dead.  Hell will deliver up its captive spirits.  The grave will deliver up its captive bodies.  The bodies and the spirits of men will be again restored one to the other.  This is possible through the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel.''}
2Ne 9:13	\Jacob{``O how great the plan of our God!  On the other side, God's spirit paradise must deliver up the righteous spirits.  The grave will deliver up the righteous bodies.  And the spirit and body will be restored again one to the other.  And the flesh all men will become incorruptible and immortal.  They will be living souls.  They will have their senses like they did in the flesh, but the veil^ will be removed.  Their new awareness will be perfect.''} 
2Ne 9:14	\Jacob{``Our knowledge^ will be perfect.  We^ will know of all of our guilt.  We will know of our uncleanness.  We will know of our nakedness.  The righteous will have a perfect knowledge of their righteousness.  They will enjoy it.  They will be clothed with purity.  They will wear the robes of righteousness.''}
2Ne 9:15	\Jacob{``All men will pass from this first (temporal) death to life.  Once they become immortal, they will appear before God's judgment seat.  The Holy One of Israel will judge them.  They will be judged according to God's holy judgment.''}
2Ne 9:16	\Jacob{``And I assure you, as God lives, as He has spoken.  His word is eternal and will not pass away.  He has said that the righteous will be righteous still.  He has said that the filthy will be filthy still.  The filthy are like the {\wicked{wicked one}} and his followers.  They will go away to an everlasting fire.  A fire prepared for them.  Their torment will be a lake of fire and brimstone.  A lake whose flames ascend up forever and have no end.''}
2Ne 9:17	\Jacob{``O the greatness and justice of our God!  He executes all His words.  Every word that has gone from His mouth must be fulfilled.  His law must be fulfilled.''}
2Ne 9:18	\Jacob{``Behold the righteous will inherit the kingdom of God.  The righteous are the saints of the Holy One of Israel.  They believe in the Holy One of Israel.  They endured crosses^ of the world.  They were not ashamed of their beliefs.  Their inheritance was prepared for them since the foundation of the world.  Their joy will be full forever.''}
2Ne 9:19	\Jacob{``O the greatness of the mercy of our^ God, the Holy One of Israel.  He delivers His saints from the awful monster the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  He delivers them from death and hell.  He delivers them from that lake of fire and brimstone.  He delivers them from endless torment.''}
2Ne 9:20	\Jacob{``O how great the holiness of our God!  He knows all things.  There isn't anything^ that He doesn't know.''}
2Ne 9:21	\Jacob{``God comes to the world that He may save all men.  If only they will listen to His voice.  He suffers the pains of all men. Yes, He suffers the pains of every^ living creature.  Both men and women.  And children.  Yes, everyone that belongs to the family of Adam.''}
2Ne 9:22	\Jacob{``God suffers this that the resurrection^ may pass to all men.  That all might stand before Him at the great judgment day.''}
2Ne 9:23	\Jacob{``God commands all men to repent.  He commands all men to be baptized^ in His name.  He commands all men^ to have perfect faith in The Holy One of Israel.  If not, the cannot be saved in the kingdom of God.''}
2Ne 9:24	\Jacob{`If men will not repent.  If men will not believe in His name.  If men will not be baptized in His name.  If men will not endure to the end.  They will be damned.  For God, the Holy One of Israel, has spoken it.''}
2Ne 9:25	\Jacob{``God has given a law.  If a law were not given, there would be no punishment.  If there is no punishment, there would be no condemnation.  If there is no condemnation, the mercies^ of the Holy One of Israel will claim them because of the atonement.  They are delivered by the power of Him.''}
2Ne 9:26	\Jacob{``The atonement satisfied the demands of His justice.  The atonement will answer for all those who never received the law.  They are delivered from that awful monster, death and hell.  They are delivered from the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  They are delivered from the lake of fire and brimstone.  They are delivered from endless torment.  And they are restored to the God that gave them breath.  Even God, the Holy One of Israel.''}
2Ne 9:27	\Jacob{``Wo unto the man that has received God's law.  If a man has God's commandments and transgresses them.  If a man^ wastes the days of his probation.  His final condition will be awful^.''} 
2Ne 9:28	\Jacob{``O the cunning plan of the {\wicked{wicked one}}! O the vainness, the frailties, and foolishness of men!  When men^ are learned, they think they are wise.  They do not listen to God's counsel.  In fact, they set aside God's wisdom.  They suppose that they know for themselves.  Their wisdom is foolishness.  The wisdom does not benefit them.  They will perish.''} 
2Ne 9:29	\Jacob{``To be learned is good.  If you listen to God's counsels.''}
2Ne 9:30	\Jacob{``Wo unto^ the rich.  The rich as to things of this world.  Because of their wealth, they despise the poor.  They persecute the meek.  They set their hearts on treasure.  Treasure is their god.  They will perish.  And their treasure will perish with them.''}
2Ne 9:31	\Jacob{``Wo unto the deaf that will not hear God's counsel. They will perish.''}
2Ne 9:32	\Jacob{``Wo unto the blind that will not see God's goodness.  They will perish.''}
2Ne 9:33	\Jacob{``Wo unto the uncircumcised of heart.  In the last day, a knowledge of their iniquites will smite them.''}
2Ne 9:34	\Jacob{``Wo unto the liar.  He will be thrust^ down to hell.'}
2Ne 9:35	\Jacob{``Wo unto the murderer.  He that deliberately^ kills, he will die.''}
2Ne 9:36	\Jacob{``Wo unto those that commit whoredoms.  They^ will be thrust down to hell.''}
2Ne 9:37	\Jacob{``Wo unto those that worship idols.  The {\wicked{wicked one}} and is followers are greatly pleased with them.''}
2Ne 9:38	\Jacob{``In fine, wo unto all those who die in their sins.  They will return to God.  They will behold^ His face.  And they will remain in their sins.''}
2Ne 9:39	\Jacob{``O my beloved brothers.  Remember the awfullness of trangressing against God.  Remember the awfullness of yielding to the enticings of that cunning one.  Remember, to be carnally-minded is death.  Remember, to be spiritually-minded is life eternal.''}
2Ne 9:40	\Jacob{``O my beloved brothers.  Give ear to my words.  Remember the greatness of God, the Holy One of Israel.  Please do not say that I have spoken hard things against you.  If you do, you rebel against the truth.  For I have spoken the words of your God and Maker.  I know that the truth is hard for the unclean to hear.  But the righteous does not fear the truth.  The righteous love the truth and are not shaken.''}
2Ne 9:41	\Jacob{``O my beloved brothers.  Come to God, the Holy One of Israel.  Remember that His paths are righteous.  Behold, the way for man is narrow.  But this way lies on a straight course to God.  And the keeper of the gate is God, the Holy One of Israel.  He does not employ^ a servant there.  And there is no other way.  This is the only gate.  And He cannot be deceived. For God is His name.''}
2Ne 9:42	\Jacob{``If one knocks^   at the gate, the Holy One of Israel will open.  But He will not open the gate for everyone.  He will not open for the wise and learned in their own wisdom.  The gates will not open for the rich who love their riches.  He despises them.  Unless they cast aside their riches and their own wisdom.  Unless they consider themselves fools before God.  Unless they come down into the depths of humility.  God will not open the gate for them.''}
2Ne 9:43	\Jacob{``God's true and practical wisdom will be hid from them forever. Yes, they will never know of the happiness prepared for God's saints.''}
2Ne 9:44	\Jacob{``O my beloved brothers.  Remember my words.  Behold I take of my garments.  I shake^ them before you.  I pray the God of my salvation has seen me speak to you with His vigilant eye^.  In the last day, all men will be judged of their works.  And God Himself will witness that I shook your iniquities from my soul.  I stand with brightness before Him.  I am rid of your blood.''}
2Ne 9:45	\Jacob{``O my beloved brothers^.  Turn away from your sins.  Shake off the chains of him that would bind you tightly.  Come to God, who is the rock of your salvation.''}
2Ne 9:46	\Jacob{``Prepare your souls.  Prepare for the glorius day.  The day when justice will be administered to the righteous.  The day of judgment.  I pray you will not shrink with awful fear.  I pray you will remember your awful guilt no more.  May God perfect you, and may you feel compelled^ to exclaim:''} \Some{``Holy, holy are your judgments, O God Almighty.  I know my guilt.  I transgressed Your law.  My transgressions are mine.  The {\wicked{wicked one}} had obtained me.  I was prey to his awful misery.''}
2Ne 9:47	\Jacob{``Behold, my brothers.  Is it necessary that I should make you aware of the awful realities of these things?  Would my words agitate^ your souls if your minds were pure?  Would you take my words to be so blunt if you were free^ of sin?''}
2Ne 9:48	\Jacob{``Behold, if you were holy, I would speak to you of holy things.  But you are not holy.  You look to me as your teacher.  It is necessary that I teach you the consequences of sin.''}
2Ne 9:49	\Jacob{``Behold, my soul abhors^ sin.  My heart delights in righteousness.  I will forever praise the holy name of God.''}
2Ne 9:50	\Jacob{``My brothers^!  Come every one that thirsts.  Come to the waters.  He that has no money.  Come procure^ and eat.  Yes, come procure wine and milk without money and without price.''}
2Ne 9:51	\Jacob{``Do not spend money on things that have no value.  Do not labor for things that cannot satisfy.  Listen diligently to me.  Remember the words I have spoken.  Come unto God, the Holy One of Israel.  Feast upon that which will not perish.  That which will not be corrupted.  Let your soul have pleasure in getting fat on this feast.''}
2Ne 9:52	\Jacob{``Behold, my beloved brothers.  Remember the words of your God.  Pray unto Him continually by day.  Give thanks to His holy name by night.  Let your hearts rejoice in God.''}
2Ne 9:53	\Jacob{``Behold, how great are God's covenants.  How great are His condescensions to the children of men.  Because of His greatness.  Because of His benevolence. Because of His mercy.  He has promised us that our seed will not utterly be destroyed in the flesh.  God has promised He would preserve^ them.  In future generations, our seed will became a righteous branch to the house of Israel.''}
2Ne 9:54	\Jacob{``Now my brothers, I want to tell you more.  But I will wait until tomorrow.  Tomorrow, I will declare^ the remainder of my words.  Amen.''}
2Ne 10:1	\Jacob{``Now I (Jacob) speak to you again, my beloved brothers.  I speak to you about the righteous branch of the house of Israel.''}
2Ne 10:2	\Jacob{``Behold, God's promises we have obtained will be fulfilled in the flesh.  It has been shown unto me that many of our children will perish in the flesh because of unbelief.  Nevertheless, God will be merciful to many.  Our children will be restored.  They will come to that which will give them the true knowledge of their Redeemer.''}
2Ne 10:3	\Jacob{``As I have said before.  It is expedient that Yeshua should come among the Jews.  (Last night, an angel told me this is the Messiah's name.)  He will be among the more wicked part of the world.  They will crucify Him.  God finds it ironic^ that this people, above all other peoples, should crucify their God.''}
2Ne 10:4	\Jacob{``If He were perform mighty miracles dwelling among any other people.  This other people would recognize Him as God.  They would repent.''}
2Ne 10:5	\Jacob{`But not the Jews.  Because of their priestcrafts.  Because of their iniquities.  They at Jerusalem will stiffen their necks against Him.  They will crucify Him.''}
2Ne 10:6	\Jacob{``They will be visited with destructions, famines, and pestilences.  Bloodshed will come upon them.  Those not destroyed will be scattered among all nations.''}
2Ne 10:7	\Jacob{``As God has said:''} \God{``When the day comes.  The day they will believe in Me.  The day they will believe that I am the Messiah.  I covenanted with their fathers that they will be restored.  In the flesh, on this earth, they will be restored to the lands of their inheritance.''}
2Ne 10:8	\God{``They will be gathered together after their long dispersion.  They will be gathered from the isles^ of the sea.  They will be gathered from the four parts of the earth.  And the Gentiles will be great in my eyes.  The Gentiles will carry them to the lands of their inheritance.''}
2Ne 10:9	\Jacob{``Yes, the kings of the Gentiles will be nourishing^ fathers for them.  The queens of the Gentiles will become their nursing mothers.  God's promises are great even unto the Gentiles.  For God has spoken it, and who will dispute this?''}
2Ne 10:10	\Jacob{``God has said that this land will be a land of your inheritance.  The Gentiles will also be blessed on this land.''}
2Ne 10:11	\Jacob{``This land will be a land of liberty for the Gentiles.  The Gentiles will not raise up any kings on this land.''}
2Ne 10:12	\Jacob{``God promises:''} \God{``I will fortify this land against all other nations.''}
2Ne 10:13	\God{``And he that fights against Zion will perish.''}
2Ne 10:14	\God{``If a nation tries to raise up a king against Me, it will perish. I am the Lord God.  I am the king of heaven.  I will be their king.  I will be a light unto them forever.    Hear My words.''}
2Ne 10:15	\God{``My covenants I have made with the children of men will be fulfilled.  In order to become a light for them forever, I must destroy the darkness.  I will destroy secret works of darkness.  I will destroy those that murder.  I will destroy all manner^ of abomination.''}
2Ne 10:16	\God{``If you fight against Zion, you will perish.  Whether you are a Jew or a Gentile.  Whether you are a servant or free.  Whether you are male or female.  If you are not with Me, you are against Me.  You will counted with the whore of all the earth.''}  
2Ne 10:17	\God{``I will fulfill my promises.  The promises I have made unto the children of men.  And these promises will be fulfilled while they are in the flesh--''}
2Ne 10:18	\Jacob{``My beloved brothers, God has told us:''} \God{``I will afflict your seed by the hand of the Gentiles.  Nevertheless, I will soften the hearts of the Gentiles.  The Gentiles will be like a father^ to them.  Because of this, the Gentiles will be blessed.  They will be numbered among the house of Israel.''}
2Ne 10:19	\God{``I will forever consecrate this land for your seed.  And those who will be numbered^ among your seed.  This land will be the land of their inheritance.  It is a choice land.  Choice above all other lands.  I will have all men that dwell in this land worship Me.''}
2Ne 10:20	\Jacob{``Now my beloved brothers.  Do you see how merciful God is?  Do you realize He has given us great knowledge?  Let us^ remember Him.  Let us lay aside our sins.  Let us not hang down our heads in shame.  We are not cast off.  We were driven out of the land of our inheritance (Jerusalem).  But we have been led to a better land.  God has made the sea our path.  And now, we are upon an isle of the sea.''}
2Ne 10:21	\Jacob{``Great are the promises of God.  He promised many on the isles of the sea.  And since He says \emph{isles} (plural), there must be other^ inhabitable lands.  And they may be inhabited by our brothers of the house of Israel.''}
2Ne 10:22	\Jacob{``Behold, from time to time, God leads away some from the house of Israel.  This is according to God's will and pleasure.  Certainly, God remembers all those He has broken off.  He also remembers us.''}
2Ne 10:23	\Jacob{``Cheer up^ your hearts.  Remember you are free to act for yourselves.  You can choose the way of everlasting death.  Or you can choose the way of eternal life.''}
2Ne 10:24	\Jacob{``My beloved brothers.  Reconcile yourselves to God's will.  Do not reconcile yourselves to the will of the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  Do not reconcile yourselves to the will of the flesh.  Remember that only through God's benevolence are you saved.  So align yourself with God.''} 
2Ne 10:25	\Jacob{``May God raise you from death by the power of the resurrection.  May God raise you from everlasting death by the power of the atonement.  May you be found worthy to one day praise God for His compassion.  May God receive you into His eternal kingdom.   Amen.''}
2Ne 11:1	Now Jacob spoke many more things to my people at that time.  Only these things I (Nephi) chose to be^ written down.  I find them sufficient.
2Ne 11:2	Now I write more of Isaiah's words.  My soul delights in his words.  I will liken his words unto my people.  I will send them forth to all my children.  For Isaiah truly saw my Redeemer.  Even as I have seen Him.
2Ne 11:3	And my brother Jacob has also seen Him.  As I have seen Him.  I will send the words of both Isaiah and Jacob to my children.  I will do so to prove to them that my words are true.  As God has said, \God{``By the unity of three witnesses, I will establish My word.''}  Nevertheless, God sends more than three witnesses.  He proves all of His words.
2Ne 11:4	Behold, my soul delights in proving to my people the truth of the coming of the Messiah.  For this end was the law of Moses given. For this end has God given man all things.  They are all resemblances of the Messiah.  They typify Him.
2Ne 11:5	My soul also delights in God's covenants.  The covenants God has made to our fathers.  Yes, my soul delights in God's benevolence.  In God's justice.  In God's power. In God's mercy.  My soul delights in God's great and eternal plan of deliverance from death.
2Ne 11:6	And my soul delights in proving^ to my people that all men must come unto the Messiah or they will perish.
2Ne 11:7	If there was not a the Messiah, there would not be a God.  And if there was not a God, there could not have been a creation.  But there is a God.  God is the Messiah.  And He comes in the fullness of His own^ time.
2Ne 11:8	And now I write some of Isaiah's prophecies.  Read these words.  Lift up your hearts.  Rejoice.  Again I say rejoice.  For all men.  Now these are the words of Isaiah.  May you apply them to yourself.  May you compare them to all men.
2Ne 12:1	\Isaiah{``The prophecy [oracle] Isaiah (son of Amoz) saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:''}  
2Ne 12:2	\Isaiah{``In the last days, the mountain of God's house will be established. Yes, it will be established above the mountains.  It will lifted up above the hills.  All nations will gaze together.  Joy will emanate.''}
2Ne 12:3	\Isaiah{``Many people will go and say:''}  \People{``Come and let us go up to God's mountain.  Let us go to the house of the God of Jacob.  He will teach us His ways.  We will walk in His paths.  God's instruction  will go forth from Zion.  These tasks will be carried out by Jerusalem.''}
2Ne 12:4	\Isaiah{``God will govern the people.  He will be an arbiter among the nations.  The people will beat their swords into plowshares.  They will beat their spears into pruninghooks.  Nation will not lift up sword against nation.  Neither will they learn war any more.''}

2Ne 24:32	\Isaiah{``Angels will testify to all nations that Jehovah has established Zion.  Zion will be a refuge for His people. Those that humbled^ themselves.''} 
2Ne 25:1	Now, I (Nephi) speak about the words I have written.  Yes, the words Isaiah spoke.  Behold, many of my people find these things hard to understand.  For they do not know^ the manner in which the Jews prophesy. 
2Ne 25:2	For I have not taught my people many things^ about the manner of the Jews.  For many of their works were works of darkness.  For many of their doings were doings of abominations.
2Ne 25:3	Wherefore, I write to my people.  Even to all those that will receive these things after I write them.  That they may know God's judgments.  God's judgments will come to all nations according to His word.
2Ne 25:4	\Nephi{``Wherefore, listen O my people.  You^ which are of the house of Israel.  Give ear to my words.  The words of Isaiah are not plain to you.  Nevertheless, they are plain to those filled with the spirit of prophecy.  I give you a prophecy according to the spirit which is in me.  I will prophesy according to the plainness which is in me.  Yes, the same plainness I have had since I came from Jerusalem with my father.  Behold, my soul delights in plainness.  I speak plainness unto you, my people, that you^ may learn.''}
2Ne 25:5	\Nephi{``Yes, my soul delights in the words of Isaiah.  For I have come from Jerusalem.  I have seen the things of the Jews with my own eyes.  I know that the Jews do understand the things of the prophets.  No other people can understand these things as well as the Jews.  Unless they were taught the manner of Jewish prophecy.''}
2Ne 25:6	Behold, I have not taught my children after the manner of the Jews.  But, I, for myself, did dwell^ with them.  Wherefore, I know about the region and its inhabitants.  And I have taught my children about the judgments of God.  God's judgments.  Things that have transpired among the Jews.  I have taught my children this history according to the words of Isaiah.  Herein, I do not write them.
2Ne 25:7	Behold, I proceed with my own prophecy.  A prophecy according to my plainness.  My plainness is such that no man can be mistaken of my message.  When the prophecies of Isaiah are fulfilled, men will truly know.  Yes, in the day the prophecies^ come to pass!
2Ne 25:8	Wherefore, the prophecies of Isaiah are of great worth to the children of men.  Among my people, some will suppose they are not of worth.  I will speak directly to them in this regard.  Nevertheless, I know they will be of great worth to those that read these prophecies in the last days.  In that day, they will understand^ these prophecies.  I am writing this for their benefit.
2Ne 25:9	One generation of the Jews has been destroyed because of iniquity.  Even so, they have been destroyed from^ generation to generation because of iniquity.  Every time they have been destroyed it was foretold by God's prophets.
2Ne 25:10	For example, prophets (including my father) told the Jews that Jerusalem was to be destroyed because of iniquity.  Yet, they hardened their hearts.  Immediately after my father left Jerusalem, Babylon^ attacked.  According to my prophecy, they have been destroyed.  A few survived and were carried away captive to Babylon.
2Ne 25:11	Now I speak more according to the spirit of prophecy in me.  \Nephi{``Even though they have been carried captive they will return again.  Yes, they will again possess the land of Jerusalem.  They will be restored to the land of their inheritance.''}
2Ne 25:12	\Nephi{``Behold, they will have wars and rumors of wars.  Eventually, God will manifest himself to them in the flesh.  Yes, the God who is the father of the creation--of heaven and earth.  Yes, the God who is the Only Begotten Son of the Eternal Father.  In the flesh, He will dwell with the Jews.  They will reject Him because of iniquity.  Because of the hardness of their hearts.  Because of the stiffness of their necks.''}
2Ne 25:13	\Nephi{``Behold, they will crucify Him.  He will lie in a sepulchre for the space of three days.  And then, He will rise from the dead with healing in His wings^.  And all those who will believe on His name will be saved in the kingdom of God.  Wherefore, my soul delights to prophesy concerning Him.  For I have seen His day.  My heart extols His Holy Name.''}
2Ne 25:14	\Nephi{``The Messiah will manifest Himself unto His people after He has risen from the dead.  He will also manifest Himself unto as many^ as will believe on His name.  After that, Jerusalem will be destroyed again.  Wo unto those that fight against God.  Wo unto those that fight against the people of His church.''}
2Ne 25:15	\Nephi{``Wherefore, the Jews will be scattered among all nations.  (Also, Babylon^ will be destroyed.)   Wherefore, the Jews are scattered by other nations.''}
2Ne 25:16	\Nephi{``After they have been scattered, God will scourge them.  For the space of many generations by many other nations.  Yes, even down from generation to generation until they will be persuaded to believe in the Messiah.  Yes, believe that He was their Messiah.  That He is the Son of God.  That He atoned for all mankind.  Yes, the infinite atonement.  In that day.  The day they will believe in the Messiah.  The day they will worship the Eternal Father in His name.  The day they have pure hearts and clean hands.  The day they no longer look for another Messiah.  Yes, in that day, they will believe all these things.''}
2Ne 25:17	\Nephi{``In that day, God will extend His hand again a second time to restore His people.  Yes, He will restore them from their lost and fallen state.  He will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder among the children of men.''}
2Ne 25:18	\Nephi{``In that day, God will bring forth His words to them.  The same words that will be used to judge them in the last day.  The words will be given to persuade and convince them of the true Messiah.  Yes, the Messiah they rejected.  The words will convince them that they do not need to look forward any more for another Messiah to come.  For another will not come, except possibly a false Messiah^ which would deceive the people.  For there is only one Messiah spoken of by the prophets.  That Messiah is He who the Jews will reject and crucify.''}
2Ne 25:19	\Nephi{``According to the words^ of the prophets, the Messiah will come six hundred years from the time my father left^ Jerusalem.  According to the words of the prophets (and according to the word of the angel of God that spoke to me), His name will be Yeshua the Annointed One, the Son of God.''}
2Ne 25:20	\Nephi{``And now, my brothers^,  I have spoken plainly.  You cannot be mistaken.  As God lives, I testify of these things.  Yes the God that delivered Israel out of the land of Egypt.  The God that gave Moses to heal the nation after they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents (\emph{nachash}).  (If they would look up to the [true] serpent^ (\emph{seraph}) Moses had placed on a staff before them.)  The God that gave Moses power to strike a rock and water would come forth.  Yes, this God.  Behold I say unto you, that God did these things.  And as God lives, I testify that there is no other name given under heaven whereby man can be saved.  That name is Yeshua the Annointed One.''} 
2Ne 25:21	Wherefore, for this cause God has commanded me to write these things.  God has promised me these writings will be preserved.  They will be handed down to my seed, from generation to generation.  And the promise God made to Joseph will also be fulfilled.  That his seed will never perish as long as the earth will stand.
2Ne 25:22	Wherefore, these writings will go from generation to generation as long as the earth will stand.  And they will go forth among nations according to God's will^ and pleasure.  The nations who possess them will be judged according to the words herein.
2Ne 25:23	For we^ labor diligently to write.  We labor diligently to persuade our children.  We labor diligently to persuade our brothers.  And after all we can do, being saved is in your own hands.  Believe in the Messiah.  Be reconciled to God.  Remember that we are only saved by His benevolence^.
2Ne 25:24	\Nephi{``We believe in the Messiah.  Nevertheless, we keep the law of Moses.  We look forward with steadfastness for the Messiah.  In that day, the law of Moses^ will be fulfilled.''}
2Ne 25:25	\Nephi{``For the law was given to look forward with steadfastness for the Messiah.  In that day, the law will become dead to us.  We are made alive in the Messiah because of our faith.  Yet, we keep^ the law because of the commandments.''}
2Ne 25:26	\Nephi{``And we talk of the Messiah.  We rejoice in the Messiah.  We preach of the Messiah.  We prophesy of the Messiah.  We write according to our prophecies.  We do so that our children may know where to look for the remission of their sins.  The only source of salvation is the Messiah.''}
2Ne 25:27	\Nephi{``We teach the law of Moses to our children that they may know the deadness of it.  By knowing its deadness, our children can look forward to the Messiah that gives life.  This is why the law was given.  After the Messiah fulfills the law, they should not harden their hearts against Him.  In that day, the law ought to be done away.''}
2Ne 25:28	\Nephi{``Now, behold, my people, you are a stiffnecked people.  Wherefore, I have spoke plainly to you.  You cannot misunderstand.  And these words I have spoken will stand as a testimony against you (in the day of judgment).  These words are sufficient to teach any man the right way.  For the right way is to believe in the Messiah and not deny Him.  If you deny the Messiah, you also deny the prophets and the law.''}  
2Ne 25:29	\Nephi{``Now, behold, I say to you that the right way is to believe in the Messiah.  Do not deny Him.  The Messiah is the Holy One of Israel.  He is Jehovah.  Wherefore, bow down before Him.  Worship Him with all your might, mind, strength.  Worship Him will your whole soul.  Do this, and it will be impossible for you to be cast out.''}
2Ne 25:30	\Nephi{``Observe and keep the ordinances of God.  Do^ so until the law of Moses is fulfilled.''}
2Ne 26:1	\Nephi{``After the Messiah rises from the dead, He will show himself to your seed.  Yes, to the seed of my children.  And the seed of my beloved brothers.  And the words which He will speak to you will be the new law.  This law you should do.''}
2Ne 26:2	\Nephi{``Many generations^ will pass away.  There will be great wars and contentions among my people.''}
2Ne 26:3	\Nephi{``There will be signs given to my people regarding the Messiah.  There will be a sign of His birth.  There will be a sign of His death and resurrection.  When that sign is given, it will be a great a terrible day for the wicked (among my people).  They will have rejected the prophets and saints.  They will have killed them, some by stoning.  Wherefore, the blood of the saints will cry from the ground.  The cry will ascend to God.  And God will respond.  The wicked will perish.''} 
2Ne 26:4	\Nephi{``Wherefore, all those who are proud.  Yes all those that do wickedly.  In that^ day, God (the Lord of Hosts) will burn them up like stubble.''}
2Ne 26:5	\Nephi{``They that kill the prophets.  They that kill the saints.  God will command the depths of the earth to swallow them up.  God will command the mountains to cover them.  God will command the whirlwinds to carry them away.  Buildings will fall^ on them and crush them to pieces and grind them to powder.''}
2Ne 26:6	\Nephi{``They will be visited with thunderings^  and lightnings.  They will be visited with earthquakes and all manner of destructions.  For the fire of God's anger will be kindled against them.  They will be as stubble.  In that day, God will consume the wicked.''}
2Ne 26:7	\Nephi{``O the pain and anguish of my soul.  My people will be killed because of iniquity.  I (Nephi) have seen it.  This reality exhausts me as I plead to God on their behalf.  Yet I know God's ways are just.''}
2Ne 26:8	\Nephi{``The virtuous will not perish.  They will listen to the words of the prophets.  They will not kill the prophets and saints.  They will look forward with steadfastness for the Messiah.  They will look forward to the signs to be given.  They will be persecuted for their beliefs.''}
2Ne 26:9	\Nephi{``The Sun^ of Righteousness will appear to the faithful.  He will heal^ them.  They will have peace in Him.  Yes, three generations will pass away in righteousness.  And many of the fourth generation will also pass away in righteousness.''}  
2Ne 26:10	\Nephi{``After this time of peace and righteousness, destruction will speedily come to my people.  And it pains my soul, but I have seen it.  I know it will happen.  They will sell themselves for not.  They will become proud and foolish.  It will result in their destruction.  They yield to the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  They choose the works of darkness rather than light.  Because of this, they must go down to hell.''}
2Ne 26:11	\Nephi{``For God's Spirit will not always strive with man.  When the God's Spirit ceases to strive with man, speedily^ destruction comes.  And this grieves my soul.''}
2Ne 26:12	\Nephi{``I have spoken how the Jews must be convinced that Yeshua is the very the Messiah.  I now emphasize that the Gentiles must also be convinced.  That Yeshua is the Messiah and the Eternal^ God.''}
2Ne 26:13	\Nephi{``By the power of the Holy Ghost, Yeshua will manifest Himself unto all those who believe in Him.  Yes, to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.  He works mighty miracles, signs, and wonders among the children of men according to their faith.''}
2Ne 26:14	\Nephi{``Now, I prophesy to you about the last days.  The days when God will bring these writings^ forth to the children of men.''}
2Ne 26:15	\Nephi{``My seed and the seed of my brothers will dwindle in unbelief.  They will be smitten^ by the Gentiles.  Yes, God will surround^ them.  A seige will be laid against them with a mount^.  Raised forts will be against them.  They will have been brought down low to the dust.  A remnant dwindled almost to extinction.  They have dwindled in unbelief but are not forgotten.  The words of the righteous will be fulfilled.  The prayers^ of the faithful will be heard.''}
2Ne 26:16	\Nephi{``Voices from the ground will speak to this remnant.  The voices of those destroyed.  Their voices^ will be as one voice.  A familiar voice from low in the dust.  God has given this voice power.  This voice will whisper^ even as it were out of the ground.  The message whispered out of the dust will be the message of those destroyed.''}
2Ne 26:17	\Nephi{``God has declared that they will record the things done to them.  And these written things will be sealed^ in a book.  Those that dwindled in unbelief will not have this record.  For the unbelievers seek to destroy^ God's things.''}
2Ne 26:18	\Nephi{``And those destroyed are done so speedily.  The multitude of the terrible ones will be as chaff that vanishes in the slightest wind.  As God has foretold: ``It will be at an instant, suddenly--''}
2Ne 26:19	\Nephi{``After, those who have dwindled in unbelief will be smitten by the hand of the Gentiles.''}
2Ne 26:20	\Nephi{``And the Gentiles will be lifted up in the pride of their eyes.  They will stumble because of their greatness.  They will have built up many churches.  Nevertheless, they put down the power and miracles of God.  They preach up their own wisdom and learning.  They do this for power and gain.  They do this to exploit^ the poor.''}
2Ne 26:21	\Nephi{``And there were will be many churches built up which cause envyings^, strifes^, and malice^.''}
2Ne 26:22	\Nephi{``And there will also be secret combinations.  Yes, secret combinations after the manner of the {\wicked{wicked one}}.  In ancient times, he fathered all wicked^ things.  He is the founder of murder.  He is the founder of all works of darkness.  Yes, he leads them by the neck with a flaxen^ cord.  He binds them with his strong cords forever.''}
2Ne 26:23	\Nephi{``Behold my beloved^ brothers.  God does not work in darkness.''}
2Ne 26:24	\Nephi{``God only does things that benefits the world.  God loves the world.  He loves the world so much than He lays down His own life.  He does this that He may draw^ all men to Him.  He invites^ all to partake of salvation.''}
2Ne 26:25	Does God say to you: \God{``Depart from Me!''}?  Behold, I answer \Nephi{``No.''}  This is what God says: \God{``Come unto Me.  Come all the ends of the earth. Yes, come procure^ wine and milk without money and without price.''}
2Ne 26:26	Does God command any of you to depart from out of the synagogues^?  Or out of the houses of worship?  Behold, I answer \Nephi{``No.''}
2Ne 26:27	Has God commanded any of you to not partake of His salvation?  Behold, I answer \Nephi{``No.''}  God has given salvation free for all men.  He has commanded His people that they should persuade all men to repent.
2Ne 26:28	Has God commanded any of you not to partake^ of His goodness?  Behold, I answer \Nephi{``No.''}  All men are privileged equally to receive of His goodness.  Everyone is welcome.
2Ne 26:29	\Nephi{``God has commanded that there will be no priestcrafts.  A priestcraft is when a man preaches and sets himself^ up to be the light of the world.  They do so to get gain^ and praise of the world.  They do not seek to support the cause of Zion.''}
2Ne 26:30	\Nephi{``Behold, God does not like this.  God commands all to love humanity.  To love the name of Jehovah is to serve^ His children.  Men are nothing without Jehovah's love.  Wherefore, if they understand this, they will not allow any laborer in Zion^ to fail.''}
2Ne 26:31	\Nephi{``The laborer in Zion will labor for Zion.  If they labor for other reasons (such as money), they will fail.''}
2Ne 26:32	\Nephi{``Again, God commanded that men should not^ murder.  That men should not lie.  That men should not steal.  That men should not take the name of their Lord God in vain.  That men should not envy.  That men should not have malice.  That men should not contend one with another.  That men should not commit whoredoms.  Yes, God commanded that men should not do any of these things or they will be destroyed.''}
2Ne 26:33	\Nephi{``None of these iniquities come from God.  For God only does that which is good for the children of men.  God does things without cunning or disguise.  And He invites all men to come unto Him.  He invites them to partake of His goodness.  And He does not deny anyone to come unto Him.  All are invited.  Black and white.  Bond and free.  Female and male.  He even remembers the heathen.  All are alike to God: the^ Jew and the Gentile.''}
2Ne 27:1	\Isaiah{``In the last days (or in the days of the Gentiles), everyone will be drunk with iniquity and all manner of abominations.  Yes, all the nations of the Gentiles.  And also the Jews.  Those on this promised land.  And also those on other lands.  Yes, even all the lands of the earth.''}
2Ne 27:2	\Isaiah{``In that^ day, God will punish them with thunder and earthquakes.  With a great^ noise.  With storms^.  With tempests.  And with the flame^ of devouring fire.''}
2Ne 27:3	\Isaiah{``All the nations that fight against Zion^.  Yes, all that distress Zion.  These nations will be like^ a dream of a night vision.  The nations will dream like a hungry man dreams.  During the dream, he eats.  But he wakes up and his soul is empty.  The nations will dream like a thirsty man dreams.  During the dream, he drinks.  But he wakes up and his soul is wanting. Yes, the multitude of all nations that fight against Mount Zion^ will be frustrated in this manner.''}
2Ne 27:4	\Isaiah{``Behold, those that do iniquity will linger in astonishment.  They will cry out and weep. They will act drunk without having had any wine.  They will stagger without having had any strong liquor.''}

2Ne 27:20	\Isaiah{``God will reply to this unlearned man:''} \God{``I will not allow the learned to read this book.  Knowing the words are from Me, the learned have refused to receive them.  I do not need an erudite.  I have you.  You will interpret the words that I give you.''}
2Ne 27:21	\God{``Behold, I will show^ the children of men that I am able to do my own work---Touch not the sealed portion.  I will bring that forth in My own due time.''}  
2Ne 27:22	\God{``I will reveal all things to the children of men when I see fit.  In My own time and wisdom.  Wherefore, you will interpret the words of the portion I have outlined.

2Ne 27:25	\God{``This people draws near Me with their words.  With their lips^ they do honor Me.  But they have distanced their hearts from Me.  According to man's precepts^ they teach a false reverence.  This is not correct.''}

2Ne 28:2	The things which will be written out of this book will be of great worth to the children of men.  They will have special value to our seed, which is a remnant of the house of Israel.
2Ne 28:3	\Nephi{``In that day, many churches will be established.  They are not God's church, but each will claim to be.

2Ne 28:8	\Nephi{``Yes, and others will say:''} \Some{``Eat, drink, and be merry!  Nevertheless fear God.  God will justify committing a little sin.  Yes, lie a little.  Take advantage of one because of God's words.  Dig a pit for your neighbor.  There is no harm in this.  Enjoy all things. For tomorrow we die.  And if it be we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes.  In the end, we will be saved in the kingdom of God.''}
2Ne 28:9	\Nephi{``Yes, many will teach in this manner.  These are false, vain, and foolish doctrines^.  Those preaching such things will be puffed up in their hearts.  They will conceal^ their profound skill from God! They will work deeds in the darkness.''}

2Ne 28:12	\Nephi{``Their churches have become corrupted.  Because of pride.  Because of false teachers.  Because of false doctrine.  Their churches are lifted up.  Because of pride their leaders are puffed up.''}
2Ne 28:13	\Nephi{``They rob the poor to build their finest temples, tabernacles, and worship centers.  They rob the poor to buy the highest-quality clothing.  They persecute the meek because of their pride.  They persecute the poor in heart because they are puffed up in their hearts.''}
2Ne 28:14	\Nephi{``They wear stiff necks and high heads.  Yes, almost all have gone astray.  Because of pride.  Because of wickedness.  Because of abominations.  Because of whoredoms.

He does so until he shackles them with his awful chains and drags them to hell.  The place where there is no deliverance.''}
2Ne 28:23	\Nephi{``Yes, they are shackled^ with death.  They are shackled with hell.  Death^, hell, the {\wicked{wicked one}}, and all those seized therewith must stand before God's throne.  To be judged according to their works.  Since^ their works shackled them to the {\wicked{wicked one}}, they must go to the place prepared for him and his followers.

2Ne 28:29	\Nephi{``Wo be unto him that will say:''} \Some{``We have received the word of God!  We need no more of God's word, for we have enough!''}

Blessed are those who listen to all my precepts.  Blessed are those that lend an ear^ to my counsel, for they will learn wisdom. For unto him that receives wisdom, to him I will give^ more.  And to him that says \emph{we have enough}, to him the wisdom he already has will be taken away.''}
2Ne 28:31	\God{``Cursed is he that puts his trust in man.  Cursed is he who makes flesh his arm.  Cursed is he that will listen to the precepts of men.  If the precepts will be given by the power of the Holy Ghost, then you know they are from Me.''}
2Ne 28:32	\God{``Wo be unto the Gentiles! Even though I stretch^ out My  hand to them from day to day, they deny me.  Nevertheless I will be merciful to them.  If they will repent and come unto Me.  Yes, all day long, my hand is stretched out still.''}
2Ne 29:1	\God{``In that day, I will do a marvelous work among the children of men.  I will remember My covenants which I have made to them.  I will set My hand again a second time to recover My people.  My people which are of the house of Israel.''}
2Ne 29:2	\God{``And I will also remember the promises which I have made to you Nephi.  And the promises I have made to your father.  That I would remember your seed.  That the words of your seed will come forth out of my mouth to your seed.  My words^ will propagate^ to the ends of the earth.  These words will be a banner to my people, which are of the house of Israel;''}
2Ne 29:3	\God{``And when My words are known, there will be many of the Gentiles that will say: \emph{A Bible! A Bible! We have a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible!}''}
2Ne 29:4	\God{``If you say this, you are a fool! Do you not know this Bible you have came from My ancient covenant people the Jews?  And how do you Gentiles thank the Jews for this Bible?''}  \Nephi{``Yes, what exactly do the Gentiles mean \emph{they have a Bible}?  (Is it their Bible?)  Do the Gentiles remember the travails and labors and pains of the Jews?  Do the Gentiles remember^ that the Jews were diligent in bringing forth the Bible?  Yes, the Bible that gives the Gentiles access to salvation!''}
2Ne 29:5	\God{``O Gentiles, have you remembered the Jews, My ancient covenant people?  No!  You have cursed them.  You have hated them. You have not attempted to restore them.  Behold, all these things will be returned^ on your own heads.  For I the Lord have not forgotten My people.''}
2Ne 29:6	\God{``You are a fool to say: \emph{A Bible, we have a Bible.  We do not need any more Bible.}  Would you have obtained a Bible if it were not for the Jews?''}
2Ne 29:7	\God{``Know you not that there are more nations than one?  Know you not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men?  That I remember those who are upon the isles of the sea.  That I rule in the heavens above and in the earth below the heavens.  That I bring forth My word unto the children of men.  Yes, even to all the nations of the earth.''}
2Ne 29:8	\God{``You murmur because you don't want more of My word?  Know you not that two testimonies are better than one?    The testimony of two nations witness that I am God.  Why would I not remember one nation like another?  Wherefore, I speak the same words to one nation like another.  When the two nations will run^ together, the testimony of the two nations will also run together.''}
2Ne 29:9	\God{``And I do this to prove to many that I am the same.  Yes, the same yesterday, today, and forever.  And I speak My words as it pleases Me.  Because I have spoken one word, you need not suppose that I cannot speak another.  For My work is not yet finished.  Neither will it be finished when the time of man ends.  My work and glory is eternal.  It will never end.''}
2Ne 29:10	\God{``Wherefore, because you have a Bible, you need not suppose that it contains^ all My words.  Neither should you suppose that I have not caused others to write more of My words.''}
2Ne 29:11	\God{``For I command all men.  Men in the east and men in the west.  And in the north and in the south.  And in the isles of the sea. I command all men to write the words which I speak^.  For out of these books which will be written I will judge the world.  Every man will be judged according to his works, according to that which is written.''}
2Ne 29:12	\God{``For behold, I will speak to the Jews and they will write My words.  And I will also speak to Nephi's people^ and they will write My words.  And I will also speak to the other^ tribes of the house of Israel, which I have led away.  And they will write My words.  Yes, I will speak to all nations of the earth and they will write My words.''}
2Ne 29:13	\God{``One day, the Jews will have the words of Nephi's people.  And Nephi's people will have the words of the Jews.  And Nephi's people and the Jews will have the words of the lost tribes of Israel.  And the lost tribes of Israel will have the words of Nephi's people^ and the Jews.''}
2Ne 29:14	\God{``One day, My people (the house of Israel) will be gathered home unto the lands of their inheritance.  And My word will also be gathered in one.   Those that fight against My word and My people will know that I am God.  That I have covenanted with Abraham.  That I would remember Abraham's seed forever.''}
2Ne 30:1	And now, my beloved brothers.  I need to tell you more.  I (Nephi) do not want you to suppose that you are more righteous than the Gentiles will be.  Behold, you will also perish if you do not keep God's commanments.  Also, do not suppose the Gentiles^ will not be utterly destroyed.
2Ne 30:2	\Nephi{``Behold, Gentiles will join God's covenant people if they will repent.  Likewise, many of the Jews will not be counted with God's covenant people if they will not repent.  For God covenants only with those that repent.  Those that accept the Messiah, who is the Holy One of Israel.''}
2Ne 30:3	Now, I want to prophesy a bit more about the Jews and the Gentiles.  Recall that this book will come forth.  It will be written to the Gentiles.  It will be sealed up again to God.  At that time, many Gentiles will believe the words written.  And they will carry the words to the remnant of our seed.
2Ne 30:4	\Nephi{``In that day, the remnant of our seed will know.  They will know about us.  They will know how we came out of Jerusalem.  They will know they are descendants of the Jews.''}
2Ne 30:5	\Nephi{``And the gospel of Yeshua the Annointed One will be declared to them.  Wherefore, they will be restored to the knowledge of their fathers.  They will be restored to the knowledge of Yeshua as the Eternal Father's Emissary.  Yes, a knowledge their fathers had possessed.''}
2Ne 30:6	\Nephi{``And then our people will rejoice.  They will know that it is a blessing to them from God's hand.  The scales^ of darkness will begin to fall from their eyes. And after a few generations, they will be a white^ and delightsome people.''}
2Ne 30:7	\Nephi{``In that day, the Jews will begin to believe^  in the Messiah.  After being scattered, the Jews will from the ends of the earth gather in.  And as many of the Jews that believe in the Messiah will also become a delightsome people.''}
2Ne 30:8	\Nephi{``In that day, God will commence His work among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.  His work to restore^ His people on the earth.''}
2Ne 30:9	\Nephi{``God will judge the weak^ in righteousness. He will argue that the meek of the earth merit justice.  He will chastise the whole earth using His words as His scepter.  He will destroy the wicked with the breath from His lips.''}
2Ne 30:10	\Nephi{``The time speedily^ comes when God will divide the people.  The wicked He will destroy.  The righteous will He spare.  The righteous will become His people.  The wicked He must destroy by fire.''}
2Ne 30:11	\Nephi{``Righteousness will be the girdle of His loins.  Yes, faithfullness will also be the girdle of His loins.''}
2Ne 30:12	\Nephi{``The wolf will dwell with the lamb.  The leopard will lie down with the young male goat.  The cattle with calves will unite with young lions.  And a little child will shepherd them.''}
2Ne 30:13	\Nephi{``And the heifer and the bear will graze together.  Their young ones will lie down together.  The lion will feed on straw like the cattle.''}
2Ne 30:14	\Nephi{``And the nursing child will play near a viper's den.  Yes, a weaned child will put his hand into the basilisk's den.''} 
2Ne 30:15	\Nephi{``Nothing will injure or corrupt in all of God's holy mountain.  For the whole earth will be replete with Jehovah's knowledge.  This knowledge will fill the world as the waters cover the sea.''}
2Ne 30:16	\Nephi{``Wherefore, the things of all nations^ will be made known.  Yes, all things will be made know to the children of men.''}
2Ne 30:17	\Nephi{``All secret things will be revealed.  Every work of darkness^ will be illuminated.  Anything sealed^  will be published.''}
2Ne 30:18	\Nephi{``Wherefore, in that day, all things ever revealed to the children of men will be made known.  For a long^ time thereafter, {\wicked{wicked one}} will have no power over the hearts of the children of men.  And now, my beloved brothers, I feel compelled to conclude^ my prophesy.''}
2Ne 31:1	Now, I (Nephi) have concluded my prophesy to you, my beloved brothers.  I cannot write but a few things.  So I choose things that I know will happen.  I also write but a few things of the words of my brother Jacob.
2Ne 31:2	So far, I am satisfied with the words I have written.  I would like to include a little bit more about the doctrine of the Messiah.  Wherefore, I will speak to you plainly.  According to the plainness^ of my prophesying.
2Ne 31:3	\Nephi{``My soul delights in plainness.  After this manner does God work^ with the children of men.  God gives light^ and understanding.  God^ speaks to men according to their understanding, in their language.''}
2Ne 31:4	Wherefore, do you remember that one prophet I told you about?  A prophet that God showed me.  \Nephi{``This prophet would baptize^ the Messiah.  Yes, even the Lamb of God.  He who will take away the sins of the world.''}
2Ne 31:5	\Nephi{``Now, the Lamb of God was holy.  Yet He was baptized by water.  He did so to fulfill all righteousness.  We are not holy.  O then, how much more do we need to be baptized.  Yes, even by^ water!''}
2Ne 31:6	\Nephi{``Now, I ask you, my beloved brothers. How did the Lamb of God fulfill all righteousness by being baptized by water?''}
2Ne 31:7	\Nephi{``Don't you know He was holy?  Even though He was holy, He was still baptized by water.  He showed the children of men an example.  Even He, in the flesh, would humble Himself before God the Eternal Father.  Even He would witness to the Eternal Father that He would obey the Father and keep the Father's ways.''}
2Ne 31:8	\Nephi{``Wherefore, after the Lamb of God was baptized by^ water, the Holy Ghost^ descended^ upon Him in the form of a dove^.''}
2Ne 31:9	\Nephi{``The Lamb of God set an example before the children of men.  This example showed them the narrowness of the gate they need to enter. This example showed them the straitness of the path they need to follow.''}
2Ne 31:10	\Nephi{``And He declares to the children of men:''} \Son{``Come follow me.''}  \Nephi{`Wherefore, my beloved brothers, how can we follow Yeshua?  To follow Yeshua^ , we need to be willing to keep the Father's commandments.''}
2Ne 31:11	\Nephi{``For the Father commands:''} \Father{``Repent! Repent! Be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son.''}
2Ne 31:12	\Nephi{``And the voice of the Son declares:''} \Son{``He that is baptized in My name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost.  As the Father has given Me the Holy Ghost.  Wherefore, follow Me.  Do the things which you have seen Me do.''}
2Ne 31:13	\Nephi{``Wherefore, my beloved brothers.  I know that if you follow the Son, then you will receive the Holy Ghost.  Yes, follow the Son with full purpose of heart.  Do not act with hypocrisy or deception before God.  Act with real intent.  Repent of your sins.  Witness to the Father that you are willing to take upon you the name of the Messiah.  Be baptized.  Yes, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water as the Father commands.  Then you will receive the Holy Ghost.  Yes, receive the baptism of fire and the baptism of the Holy Ghost.  Then you will be able to speak with the tongues^ of angels.  Then you will be able to shout praises to the Holy One of Israel.''}
2Ne 31:14	\Nephi{``But, behold, my beloved brothers.  Then the voice of the Son declares:''} \Son{``After receiving the Holy Ghost, you better not deny Me!  Having repented of your sins.  Having witnessed to the Father you are willing to keep My^ commandments.  Having received baptism by water.  Having received baptism of^ fire and of the Holy Ghost.  Being able to speak with a new tongue; yes, even with the tongue of angels.  After all this, should you deny Me, it would have been better for you that you had never known Me.''}
2Ne 31:15	\Nephi{``And the Eternal Father adds:''} \Father{``Yes, the words of My Beloved are true and faithful.  He that endures to the end will be saved.''}
2Ne 31:16	\Nephi{``And now, my beloved brothers.  I know by this^ that a man needs to endure to the end to be saved.  We must follow the example of the Son of the living God.''}
2Ne 31:17	\Nephi{``Wherefore, do the things which I have told you.  Yes, do the things which I have seen your Lord and your Redeemer will do.  The reason I have seen these things is so that you might know the gate by which you need to enter.  That gate is repentance and baptism by water.  Then, the remission of your sins will come by fire and by the Holy Ghost.''}
2Ne 31:18	\Nephi{``And then you are on the path.  Yes, the vector that leads to eternal life.  You have entered the gate.  You have agreed to walk in the ways of the Father and His Son.  You have received the Holy Ghost.  The Holy Ghost witnesses^  of the Father and His Son. You received the Holy Ghost after entering on the path as the Father and His Son^ promised.''}
2Ne 31:19	\Nephi{``You entered the gate because of your faith in the word of the Messiah.  You relied wholly on the merits of Him who is mighty to save.  And now, my beloved brothers.  After you begin the journey of walking in Godly ways, are you done?  \emph{No, you are not done.}  You have come this far only because of the benevolence of the Messiah.''} 
2Ne 31:20	\Nephi{``Wherefore, you only entered the gate.  Now, you must press forward^ on the path. You must have a steadfastness in the Messiah.  You must have a perfect brightness of hope.  You must love God^  and men.  Wherefore, if you press^ forward.  If you feast upon the word of the Messiah.  If you endure to the end.  Behold, the Father will declare:''} \Father{``You will have eternal life.''}
2Ne 31:21	\Nephi{``And now, behold, my beloved brothers.  This is the way.  There is not another way.  No, there is not another way or name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God.  And now, behold, this is the doctrine of the Messiah.  This is the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  Unified^ in purpose and without end of days.  Amen.''}
2Ne 32:1	\Nephi{``Now, behold, my beloved brothers.  I suppose you are pondering^ in your hearts about what you should do next after entering the gate.  But, I ask, ``Why would you have to ponder this thing in your hearts?''}
2Ne 32:2	\Nephi{``Did you not hear what I said?!  After you received the Holy Ghost you will be able to speak with the tongue of angels.  Now, what will you speak with tongues of angels after receiving the Holy Ghost?''}
2Ne 32:3	\Nephi{``Angels speak^ by the power of the Holy Ghost.  Wherefore, angels speak the words of the Messiah.  This is why I told you to feast upon the words of the Messiah.  For behold, the words of the Messiah will tell you all things you should do after entering the gate.''}
2Ne 32:4	\Nephi{``Wherefore, if you cannot understand^ me now, you must perish in the dark.  You will perish because you do not ask (God in prayer).  You do not knock.  You are not in the light.''}
2Ne 32:5	\Nephi{``Behold, I again tell you.  Enter the gate in baptism by fire^.  Receive the Holy Ghost.  And the Holy Ghost will show to you all things that you should do.''}
2Ne 32:6	\Nephi{``Behold, this is the doctrine of the Messiah.  There will be no more doctrine given^ until the Messiah visits you in the flesh.  In that day, the Messiah will give you additional things to observe^ and do.''}
2Ne 32:7	And now I (Nephi) cannot say more.  The Spirit restrains me.  I am left to mourn because of men^.  Because of unbelief.  Because of wickedness.  Because of ignorance.  Because of the stiffneckedness of men.  They will not search^ knowledge. They will not understand great knowledge.  Even when it is given^ to them in plainness.  Even as plain as a word can be.
2Ne 32:8	And now, my beloved brothers.  I perceive you are still pondering these things in your hearts.  It grieves me you do not understand.  You would understand if you^ would pray.  \Nephi{``Yes, the Spirit teaches a man to pray. You must pray.  The evil spirit does not teach a man to pray.  In fact, he teaches man that he must not pray.''}
2Ne 32:9	\Nephi{``But behold, I say to you that you must pray always.  Do not falter in this.  Before you do^  anything (related to God) pray. Yes, pray to the Father in the name of the Messiah.  Pray that God will consecrate your performance.  Indeed that your performance will be for the welfare of your soul.''}
2Ne 33:1	And now I (Nephi) cannot write all the things which were taught my people.  Neither am I mighty in writing.  I am better at speaking.  When a man speaks by the power of the Holy Ghost. The power of the Holy Ghost carries the message to the hearts of the children of men.
2Ne 33:2	But behold, there are many that harden their hearts against the Holy Spirit.  It has no place in them.  Wherefore, they throw away^ the things written.  They do not value them.
2Ne 33:3	\Nephi{``Nevertheless, I have written what I have written. I esteem them to have great value.  Especially for my people.  I pray for them continual by day.  And my eyes water my pillow by night.  Because of the, I cry unto my God in faith.  And I know that God will hear my cry.''}
2Ne 33:4	\Nephi{``And I know God will consecrate my prayers for the gain of my people.  And the words which I have written in weakness^ will be made strong to them.  That my words will persuade my people.  Persuade them to do good.  Persuade them to remember their fathers.  Persuade them to believe in Yeshua.  Persuade them to endure to the end, which is life eternal.''}
2Ne 33:5	\Nephi{``My words speak harshly against sin.  According to the plainness of truth.  And if a man is angry^ at my words, it is because that man has a spirit^ of the {\wicked{wicked one}}.''}
2Ne 33:6	\Nephi{``I glory in plainness.  I glory in truth.  I glory in Yeshua (\emph{halal}).  For He has redeemed my soul from hell.''}
2Ne 33:7	\Nephi{``I love my people. I have great faith in the Holy One of Israel, the Lamb of God.  I believe that I will meet many souls^ spotless at His judgment-seat.''}
2Ne 33:8	\Nephi{``I love the Jews.  When I say Jew, I mean the people of Jerusalem from where I came.''}
2Ne 33:9	\Nephi{``I also love^ the Gentiles.  I have hope for the Gentiles that will reconcile themselves with the Messiah.  Those that will enter into the narrow gate.  Those that will walk in the strait path that leads to eternal life.  I hope they will continue on the path until the end of their days of probation.''}
2Ne 33:10	\Nephi{``Now, my beloved brothers.  Yes, and also my brothers among the Jews.  And also all those that receive these words.  Listen to these words and believe in the Messiah.  Even if you do not believe these words, believe in the Messiah.  I hope that if you believe in the Messiah, you will believe these words.  For these words are the words of the Messiah.  Yes, He has given them to me.  And these words teach all men that they should be good.''}
2Ne 33:11	\Nephi{``And if you do not believe^ these words to be the words of the Messiah, be forewarned!  At the last day, you and I will stand face-to-face before God's judgment bar.  The Messiah will show you, with power and great glory, that these words are His words.  And you will know that the Messiah had instructed me to write these things, notwithstanding my weakness.''}
2Ne 33:12	\Nephi{``And I pray to the Father in the name of the Messiah.  I pray that many of us, if not all of us, may be saved in His kingdom in that great and last day.''}
2Ne 33:13	\Nephi{And now my beloved brothers.  And all those of the house of Israel.  And all ends of the earth that receive these things.  I speak to you as the voice of one crying from the dust: ``Farewell^ until that great and last day will come.''}
2Ne 33:14	\Nephi{``And to those that will not partake of the goodness of God.  To those that will not respect the words of the Jews.  To those that will not respect my words.  To those that will not respect the words that proceed directly out^ of the mouth of the Lamb of God.  To those, I bid you an everlasting farewell.  For at that great and last day, these words^ will condemn you.''}
2Ne 33:15	\Nephi{``For what I seal^ on earth, will be brought against you at the judgment bar.  For thus has God directed me.  And I must obey. Amen^.''}
